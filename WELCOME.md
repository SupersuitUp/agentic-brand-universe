# Welcome

You talk. It builds. That is the whole interface.

Agentic Brand Universe runs inside your AI harness. You describe what you want in
plain language and the harness operates the machinery: it makes the images, holds the
look steady across everything, remembers what your characters and places look like,
and refuses to render something it does not have the references for.

**You are not expected to learn any commands.** Two install lines below, and after
that you talk. An earlier version of this page was a list of things to type, which is
the wrong shape: in this model you state intent and the console does the operating.

## Install

In Claude Code, run these two lines. They are the only two you will ever type.

    /plugin marketplace add SupersuitUp/agentic-brand-universe
    /plugin install abu

Then say:

> **set me up**

It checks everything, installs what is missing, and tells you in plain sentences what
is ready and what is blocked. Two things it cannot do for you, because both are
credentials rather than chores: installing Claude Code itself, and getting an image
API key. It will say so if either is missing.

Then tell it what you are making. If you already have images you like, say that first.
It is the fastest path to a result.

## Once you are running

Say:

> **abu**

That is the front door. Hand it nothing and it tells you where your universe stands,
what the single highest-leverage next thing is, and a ten-minute version if you are
just browsing. It scores your universe out of 100 and remembers the last score, so it
can tell you what moved since Tuesday rather than only where you are today.

Everything else is a wish said out loud:

> *make more images that look like these*
> *this character keeps changing between pictures*
> *the room is a different shape on every page*
> *make a zine cover*
> *is this any good yet*
> *what should I do next*
> *I'm bored*

You never need to know which verb handles which wish. That is the harness's job.

## The one idea worth knowing up front

Most AI image work drifts. You get something great, then the next one is subtly
different, and by the tenth you cannot get back to the first. This exists to stop
that.

The look and the characters live in **locked reference images**, not in words you
retype. When something must appear the same everywhere, the framework refuses to draw
it until it actually has the reference on disk, because a picture of the wrong
character is far more expensive than a hard stop. It looks fine, so it passes review,
and you find out ten pages later.

You do not need this on day one. If you are making a zine and only the *style* has to
stay consistent, a style pack plus a gate is enough, and the harness will set that up
for you when you ask.

## Where the details live

You should not need these, but they are here.

- [`docs/REFERENCE.md`](./docs/REFERENCE.md) every skill, verb, form and provider,
  generated from the code so it cannot go stale.
- [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](./docs/GLOSSARY.md) the vocabulary, each term defined by what
  it refuses.
- [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) the contract.
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) how the six layers fit.
