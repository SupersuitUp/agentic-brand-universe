# Agentic Brand Universe — Cartridge Spec

**v0.61 — 2026-10-13.** The version-controlled brand-universe (cartridge) format: the first-principles
architecture for a brand as version-controlled canon + golden assets, agentically writable,
composable, and evolvable, rendered into any deliverable. Home: `agenticbranduniverse.com`.
Reference implementations: the Nation of Fire universe (storybooks) and Build on Anthropic (a
documentation brand: explanatory plates, ink-line illustration, share cards, a slide deck).

> **v0.61 changelog — the LINES: a universe holds its brand's approved language, with every
> wording it has had.** §13.2: a craft-canon record of the new kind `lines` names its `approvers`
> and holds `lines`, each an id, a name, what it is for, its `text`, a `version`, a `history` of
> every earlier wording, the `audiences` it may reach, a `status` (candidate, golden, retired) and
> `decided` {by, on, verbatim}. `validate` refuses a golden line with no recorded yes or a yes
> from a non-approver, a version that disagrees with its history, and a duplicate wording.
> `abu lines` lists them; `abu line-add`, `line-bless`, `line-reword` and `line-retire` are the
> only writers, and a write `validate` would refuse is rolled back. A verb creates only a
> universe's first lines record and never changes its `approvers`. For every craft kind,
> `validate` now also refuses one craft `id` declared by two files in `canon/craft`, which used
> to let the later file replace the earlier one with no word said.

> **v0.60 changelog — the KIT: a universe catalogs its brand's pieces and no-gos, and a gate
> reads the no-gos.** §13.1: a craft-canon record of the new kind `kit` holds `pieces` (a
> reusable part with what it is for, an exact `recipe` or a `definedAt` pointer into the canon
> that already defines it, where it is used, and who decided it, when, in what words) and
> `noGos` (what is refused, why, the piece to use `instead`, the same provenance, an optional
> `source` quote that must still be in canon, an optional `supersedes` line that must no longer
> say the old thing, and optional `detect` patterns). `validate` refuses every malformed item;
> `abu kit` lists them; `abu check-kit <universe> <paths>` scans a surface's source and exits 1 on
> any no-go it can detect. §3.2: the scaffolded `assert.sh` now CHOOSES its engine (override, baked
> path, newest installed plugin) and refuses one older than the spec the universe pins. Earned 2026-10-06 on continental-works: Gary rejected the six stripes
> down one edge of a selected card and asked ABU to catalog "all these different Lego pieces of
> the brand and no-goes"; the refused shape was itself canon, and nothing could read a refusal.

> **v0.59 changelog — a universe declares the SURFACE ROLES a renderer outside it paints in.**
> §11: `identity.surfaces` maps a surface (`default`, `deck`, `artifact`, ...) to a canon record
> (`"tokens": "<file>#<dot.path>"`) and names which token in it is the `ground`, the `text` and
> the `accent`, plus an optional `display` font family. `validate` refuses a declaration whose
> file, path, role or hex does not resolve, and one with no `default`. Earned by freedom#163: the
> first two universes Freedom renders in keep their colors in different files, and their token
> NAMES mean opposite things (Christofuturism's `ink` is text, Continental Works' is ground).

> **v0.58 changelog — a PREFERRED TERM is a voice rule the gate enforces.** §11:
> `identity.voice.preferTerms` lists entries of `{prefer, avoid, except, when, severity,
> decided}`: the house term, the bare forms it replaces (patterns), and the ordinary senses
> that must never fire (patterns). voice-gate reports a bare form as `prefer-term` (REVIEW,
> waivable with a reason, or BLOCK by `severity`) with the line rewritten as a suggestion,
> and the preferred term in the wrong case as `prefer-term-case` (BLOCK). lint-universe
> refuses a malformed entry or an uncompilable pattern by name and warns when `except` is
> absent. Earned 2026-09-29 on continental-works: "Always capitalize Edge and ideally say
> Agentic Edge always" had no field, so the universe recorded it as prose the gate never
> read, and `capitalize` could not hold a bare "Edge" without flagging every border.

> **v0.57 changelog — reuse what already draws it, never redraw it from prose.**
> §4.1.1: any entity may declare
> `structured.implementation` (`component` | `generator` | `asset` | `none`) naming what
> already draws it, with `compareAgainst`, an image of the live original, required for a
> component. `referenceable_sheets` offers that original to every consumer, `on-brand-image
> --entity` passes it first and makes the side-by-side comparison a read-back invariant,
> and `lint-universe` errors `IMPLEMENTATION-MISSING` on a pointer to nothing and warns
> `MOTIF-PROSE-ONLY` on a used motif, prop or visual-metaphor with neither a locked render
> nor an implementation. Earned by continental-works' continent motif, redrawn from one
> sentence as flat squares beside the ribbon.

> **v0.56 changelog — who may be in a place, where a copy came from, and nothing re-sync does
> not own is lost.** §12: a setting may declare `structured.occupants: [ids]`; a spread casting
> any other character or group into it is refused unless the setting sets `allowGuests` or the
> spread lists the visitor in `guests: [ids]` (G16: a stranger staged in a real family's home
> shipped). §4.2: a relation side may name another universe as `<universe>:<id>`, well-formed
> when the sibling is absent and checked when it is present (#54). §4.6: `compose-spec` re-sync
> carries forward every spread key it does not own (it silently dropped the caption `pos`,
> `anonymous`, `guests`). A Style Pack scaffold requires `textPolicy` (G41).

> **v0.55 changelog — gap-register sweep, batch 2: declared vocabulary instead of literals.**
> §12: `contract.anchorShot` names a visual-metaphor's anchor plate (default `master`, G4);
> `contract.blueprintWaived: "<reason>"` waives the blueprint for a visual-metaphor with no
> massable geometry and is reported, not honoured, on a setting (G6); `abu add-look` authors an
> alt-look and refuses one with no face source, `--chain-from` a sibling era enforcing shoot order
> (G18); `structured.render.poses.<key>.dropSheets` drops a contradicted base sheet exactly as a
> look's does (G1); `structured.alsoKnownAs` feeds the uncast-name guard, and `allowUncast` may be
> a LIST of ids so one false positive does not disarm the guard (G14). §4.11: `shape: "transform"`
> for a generator whose output path is the caller's, and a `generators/` folder holding a program
> with no manifest is a validate problem. §4.13: an `insert` that casts a person is refused by
> `audit_spec_shots` (G34). A fresh character is born with an empty `structured.render` block and
> lint ERRORs on it only once a story casts it (G17). Every `prompts.md` shot body is
> self-contained; a body deferring to text "described above" is refused (G28b).

> **v0.54 changelog — one register resolver for every tool, and a gap-register sweep.** §4.7: a
> register that declares only a `stylePack` renders as well as shoots; `compose-spread`, `cover`
> and `shoot-references` all read `agenticstory.register` (G22). §12: an alt-look's own
> `photoStack` / `anchorPhoto` REPLACE the base photo stack at shoot time and reach the render too,
> base photos riding along only with `keepPhotos` (G26); the alt-look face fallback reads the
> legacy `face` key and refuses a declared-but-missing face sheet (G3); a seed blessing records
> WHO blessed it (`--bless-seed --by`, G12); a shot body opening "NOT USED" is refused whenever it
> would be painted (G19); a frozen recipe keeps its `generator` / `deterministic` marker, so a
> locked massing blueprint stays code-drawn (#47). Covers: a non-character hero's plate is
> selected by `--hero id:plate`, `--hero-pose` on one is refused, and the default follows canon's
> `requiredForRender` (G15, G33).

> **v0.53 changelog — a STRIP is a spec, and its one recipe passes a wiki's provenance gate by
> construction.** §4.15: `compose-strip` takes two to four panels (world, entities, refs, scene
> each), renders every roll through the entity route, records the agent's read-back verdict per
> roll (a defect needs a reason, the reject is moved to `panels/rejected/`, its counter binds the
> later rolls; cap is the first roll plus four re-rolls), composes in code, and writes ONE
> composite recipe (`mode: "composite"`, `compositor`, every panel's exact prompt and every ref at
> the top level, each panel's full recipe under `panelRecipes`), refusing one that would not pass.
> Earned by four hand-built strips on 2026-09-25 whose `compose.py` recipes the supersuit.wiki
> gate refused. A works-board re-roll of a strip reopens a panel instead of re-rolling the
> composite.

> **v0.52 changelog — a batch of WORKS is approved on a board too, and no board shows what
> is not a current candidate.** §3.5.1: a works board (`approve-works`) takes a manifest of
> finished works (image, title, context line, recipe), puts one batch per page on the
> operator's phone, and records APPROVE (`keep`) or RE-ROLL (`reroll`) with an optional typed or
> spoken note in the same `seen` sidecar and under the same refusals as the shot board, so a
> works verdict and a shot verdict are one fact in one place. A re-roll's note is kept for
> `reroll-slot --note`. And one rule for both boards (`agenticstory/candidates.py`): nothing under
> `rejected/`, `superseded*/`, `candidates/`, `photos/` or `pre-reroll-*/`, and no earlier roll
> kept as `<slug>.rN.png`, is ever boarded; the shot board had read a `superseded-*` folder as a
> look and shown retired plates beside live ones (2026-09-24).

> **v0.51 changelog — the board SHOWS the art, because an `AskUserQuestion` preview is
> TEXT.** §3.5: v0.50 proved the operator tapped a card NAMING a file and proved nothing
> about whether the picture was ever in front of them, which its own map recorded as still
> open. A choice that requires LOOKING at an artifact now goes to a **frapp** — a page served
> off the operator's own machine, reachable from their phone — and the thing that serves the
> image is the thing that records the tap, so "was the art displayed" stops being a claim an
> agent makes and becomes a fact the page knows. A decision answerable FROM WORDS stays an
> `AskUserQuestion` card in the terminal, because a web page for a yes/no spends the
> operator's attention for nothing; that discriminator is the general rule, and shot approval
> is its first case. Every board stamps the CHANNEL it was shown on, `record_serve` is
> written by the page from inside the response that sent the bytes, and an approving tap on a
> frapp board that never served is REFUSED. With no Freedom install there is no frapp: the
> board falls back to the card and the approval is recorded as `unshown` with the reason, so
> a lock resting on a filename is one grep away and can never be mistaken for one resting on
> a picture. Nothing of the frapp library is vendored; ABU resolves the newest installed
> Freedom at start, exactly as a scaffolded frapp does.
>
> **v0.50 changelog — what COUNTS as an operator having seen a shot, and the half of the
> no-command rule a gate cannot see.** §3.5: a shot is SEEN when the operator taps an
> `AskUserQuestion` card, the tap is recorded beside the image in the v0.49 sidecar as
> `seen`, and `lock_shot` refuses a shot with no approving verdict; the board carries a
> `preview` on every option, so the off-list answer is written into the question TEXT, which
> is the only place the side-by-side layout cannot drop it. Five refusals guard the record,
> including bytes that changed after the yes, because a re-roll writes the new picture at the
> same path. §15: `review_run.py` now reads every assistant TEXT block through the same
> `command_in()` and reports what the agent showed the operator on its own account, which is
> the half no in-run gate can see. The guard check declines an off switch, written down as a
> decision so nobody restores it as an oversight. And the scaffolder's `.gitignore` finally
> ignores `*.readback.json`, which the SPEC has called a never-shipped build artifact since
> v0.49 while nothing ignored it.
>
> **v0.49 changelog — three rules that were written as gates and enforced only by prose.**
> §3.5: a fired prompt guard now needs a RECORDED verdict (`<image>.readback.json`) and
> `verify_render.py` refuses without one, because an unjudged gate and a passed gate looked
> identical from outside; and `contact_sheet.py --cover` makes the partial-sheet refusal
> that `shoot-references` already claimed real. §15: the front door's one hard rule, never
> show the user a shell command, is enforced in code, because the grader's own `fix` strings
> reached the operator through two paths the rule was written to close. §12: `add-prop` and
> `add-visual-metaphor` now force a size the way `add-setting` and `add-character` do, and
> `PROP-NO-SCALE` reads the field the compiler actually emits.
>
> **v0.48 changelog — a prompt guard that fires is also a read-back assertion.** Every standing
> prompt guard (§3.5, `providers/*/prompt_guards.py`) now has a matching entry in `READBACK_GATE`,
> and `generate.py` writes the ones that fired into the recipe as `guards` and `guardGate`, which
> `render-readback` evaluates alongside the pack gate and the entity gate. Earned 2026-09-12 by a
> wiki hero whose prompt carried the device-anatomy guard verbatim and still shipped with the
> laptop's screen toward the camera and its user behind the lid: the instruction lost, and no line
> on the checklist told the reader to look. Gary: "no more screens on the wrong side of a device."
>
> **v0.47 changelog — the board of next moves.** §15.
>
> **v0.46 changelog — binding an entity inherits its guard.** `generate.py` writes `entityGate`
> into the recipe (each bound entity's invariants) and the readback of that render is the pack
> gate plus every entity gate (§3.5). Earned by the same four covers as v0.45: the checklist they
> were judged against never mentioned the mark's proportions.
>
> **v0.45 changelog — a pack can require an entity.** `requiredEntities` on a Style Pack (§4.7)
> makes `generate.py` refuse a render that does not bind each listed canon id via `--entity`, with
> `--waive-entity` as the recorded per-render exception. Earned by four album covers that drew the
> North Star Cross from prose while the pack's note said not to.
>
> **v0.44 changelog — a re-roll no longer destroys good art.** `render_spread` moves the
> previous output to `<out>.prev` instead of deleting it, keeps it on total failure, and
> never restores it to `<out>`, so a flaky provider costs a re-roll rather than a picture
> while every existence check still reads a failure as a failure. See 4.6.
>
> **v0.43 changelog - a scale plate can now be MADE, and two people can be the measure
> (§12).** `lint-universe` has warned `CHARACTER-HEIGHT-UNDEPICTED` since v0.22 and
> `structured.scale.relativeTo` has been load-bearing since v0.10, so the framework asked
> for the artifact and shipped no verb that produces it. The consequence was a scratch
> render-spec written, rendered once and thrown away, which happened twice in one session
> (nation-of-fire, 2026-08-20, `gary-sheng` + `larrance-dopson`) before anyone promoted it.
> `shoot-references/scripts/scale_plate.py <universe> <id> <id> [...]` renders a
> multi-character height comparison and, with `--register`, locks it as the `scale-plate`
> sheet on every character in it.
>
> **A PERSON OF RECORDED HEIGHT IS A MEASURED REFERENCE.** v0.22 defined a character
> `scale-plate` as SOLO against a measured reference, distinguishing it from v0.10's
> pair-at-relative-height. Both answer real questions and the solo one is strictly better
> for absolute height, but it has a failure mode v0.22 could not have known: the measured
> reference is usually a RULE, a rule carries NUMBERS, and numbers are TEXT. Two solo
> attempts in that same session failed exactly there, the first rendering a subject at 5'8"
> when the prompt said 6'0" and the second returning a rule numbered 6'0", 4'4", 2'8", 1'2",
> 0'2". A second person whose own height is recorded in canon is a reference with no text in
> it at all, and for the case that actually matters (two characters sharing a frame) it is
> the more useful artifact. So a multi-character plate SATISFIES the character `scale-plate`
> slot; it is not a lesser substitute for one.
>
> The scene text is DERIVED from each entity's `structured.scale`, never authored by the
> caller, so the plate cannot contradict the record it exists to depict, and every adjacent
> pair contributes its own sentence rather than one vague tallest-to-shortest. A pair with no
> declared relation says so in the prompt instead of inventing a dramatic difference. The
> verb REFUSES pre-spend on: fewer than two characters, a duplicate id, a non-character, and
> an entity with no locked sheets.

> **v0.42 changelog - a FEATURE's extent can be measured, so a gate stops being an opinion
> (§3.5.1).** `measure.py` could measure a BODY (`figure`) and a MEDIUM (`periodic`, `patch`).
> It could not measure how far one THING on the sheet runs, so every gate phrased as a length or
> a count stayed exactly as checkable as "coarse" was before v0.40, which is to say not at all.
> proof-of-vibes' `pov-fine-screen-halftone` (2026-08-20) failed its own round-trip on its
> prismatic-fringe assertion TWICE, on two different ref sets, both calls made by eye and in
> prose and therefore not comparable to each other; it was the last gate on that pack still
> judged by looking, dot pitch and sky colour both having been promoted to rulers earlier the
> same day (filed as G38). So: **`measure extent <image> --feature warm-chroma`**, reporting per
> connected region the bbox and area as frame fractions, the extent along the region's OWN
> PRINCIPAL AXIS (a fringe tracing a cloud edge is diagonal, so bbox width understates it and the
> diagonal overstates it), the peak chroma, and `occupancy`, the fraction of bins along that axis
> carrying pixels. **Occupancy is the half of the claim that is not length**, and it is why a
> SHORT stretch that came back smooth and saturated can be refused by number rather than by
> argument. **The predicate is the product, and it is stated by the caller, never guessed:** three
> predicates were tried against the real plates first and all three scored the SHEET rather than
> the feature on it, which is why the no-cool-ground refusal exists rather than a fourth silent
> guess. Three refusals, each hit for real: no cool ground to depart from, a mask covering over
> 25% of the frame (a description of the ground, not a feature), and a largest region touching the
> frame edge (a lower bound, not a measurement). **Finding no feature is a MEASUREMENT, not a
> refusal**, because the pack that earned this has a control ref with no fringe at all and
> refusing on it would make the control unmeasurable. `--blur` and `--bridge` both change which
> question is being asked, so both are recorded, and bridging never inflates area. The payoff was
> immediate and it reversed a standing verdict: the pack's blessed refs measured 0.077 to 0.274 of
> frame width against rejected drawn-rainbow plates at 0.456 to 0.696, and the twice-rejected
> round-trip measured 0.150, inside the blessed band on every axis. **The gate had been stricter
> than the plates its own pack was built from.** 13 tests, 5 mutations proven to bite. Closes G38.

> **v0.41 changelog - a Style Pack can say WHICH refs a human actually blessed (§4.7).** The
> definition of a pack has always been "3-8 BLESSED reference images", and nothing on disk
> could carry that claim: `scaffold.py` copies every ref identically, so a ref the operator
> approved by name and a candidate swept in beside it were byte-indistinguishable, and the
> approval survived only as prose. proof-of-vibes' `pov-fine-screen-halftone` (2026-08-20)
> shipped seven refs of which exactly two were individually blessed, a fact recorded only in
> a work folder's NOTES.md, which is the failure that universe's own craft canon has written
> down twice. Gary then blessed a third by name and there was no verb to record it with: the
> framework's two blessing primitives, `chain_matrix.py --bless-seed` and `abu import-asset
> --blessed-by`, are entity-scoped and import-scoped and neither takes a pack. So:
> **`bless_ref.py <pack> --ref <name> --by "<who, when>"`**, writing
> `<pack>/refs/<ref>.blessed.json` beside the ref exactly as its recipe sits, which is what
> lets a pack REBUILD carry the blessing along and what keeps `pack.json` a description of
> the look rather than a ledger of who said yes. **The `sha256` is the load-bearing part:** a
> render has no seed, so "the same prompt again" is a different picture, and binding the
> marker to the bytes makes a re-rolled ref read STALE instead of silently inheriting an
> approval of an image nobody saw. **`--by` is required and is never defaulted to `"human"`**,
> the shortcut `--bless-seed` took (G12) that leaves its markers unable to tell the operator
> from a delegated agent read-back. Four refusals, each a way the record could become a lie:
> an unlisted ref, a listed ref missing from disk, an overwrite without `--rebless` (the
> previous approver is kept under `replaced`), and no `--by`. `--status` counts coverage and
> **warns specifically when the ANCHOR is unblessed**, because the anchor is passed FIRST on
> every render a pack ever makes; `scaffold.py` prints the same line at the end of a build,
> where the operator is already looking. Partial coverage is a normal, honest state. Reporting
> it as full is the thing this closes. 15 tests. (Does NOT close G36, which wants the pack's
> EVIDENCE BASE and anchor reasoning; that is a manifest schema change and stays open.)

> **v0.40 changelog - a MEDIUM can now be measured, not just judged (§3.5.1).** `measure.py`
> could measure a BODY (`figure`) and nothing else, so every property of a MEDIUM stayed a
> word. proof-of-vibes' cloud exploration (2026-08-20) asked a halftone plate for a COARSE
> screen across three rounds and got a fine one every time, and nobody could tell, because
> "coarse" is not a number. Round 3 hand-rolled an autocorrelation dot-pitch ruler and a
> patch-mean colour ruler over nine plates and threw both away; round 4 needed the identical
> method hours later to stay comparable. Same story `measure figure` was built for, replayed
> on the medium. So: **`measure periodic`** (the fundamental spatial period of a repeating
> screen — halftone pitch, weave, grid — reported as dots-across-frame-width) and **`measure
> patch`** (mean colour over a region, and its MAX PER-CHANNEL distance from a target).
> Both REQUIRE a patch in fractional frame coordinates and record it, because a pitch read
> over a cloud is not a pitch read over open sky and a mean colour is entirely a statement
> about which pixels were averaged. Three refusals rather than three guesses, each one hit
> for real: a flat patch, a patch at FULL INK COVERAGE (a halftone at solid has no dots left
> to measure), and a peak ladder with no harmonic in it. **The harmonic rule is the load-
> bearing part.** A screen peaks at p, 2p, 3p, and on a rotated 45-degree screen the harmonic
> is routinely LOUDER than the fundamental, so "take the strongest peak" reports 2p and HALVES
> the dot count — which is exactly how the round-3 hand-roll and this module first disagreed,
> with neither able to show its work. The pick is therefore the smallest peak that HAS a
> harmonic, and the whole ladder is recorded as the evidence that reconciles two measurements
> differing by an integer factor. **Contract change:** `<image>.measure.json` is now keyed by
> kind (`{"periodic": {...}, "patch": {...}}`) instead of one flat record, because a plate
> legitimately carries several measurements and the flat shape silently DELETED the previous
> one; a legacy flat record is folded under its own kind rather than dropped. Also fixed:
> `measure.py` declared only `pillow` in its PEP 723 block while importing numpy since the day
> it shipped, so `uv run measure.py` — the invocation that block exists to enable — had never
> once worked. 14 tests.

> **v0.39 changelog - four paves out of the takeoff-thursdays run (hyperagentic-age, 2026-08).**
> **(1) The migrator a refusal had been naming ships.** The BAKE-USED-AS-A-SELECTOR refusal has
> told every operator since it landed that "`migrate_render_spec.py translate <spec>` converts a
> whole spec", and no such file existed anywhere in the repo: the refusal pointed at a phantom
> tool, and takeoff-thursdays hand-rolled the bake-to-plate translation as declared debt, the
> second hand-roll of the same translation. `compose-spread/scripts/migrate_render_spec.py`
> exists now (dry-run by default, `--write` to apply, previous bytes kept beside the spec), and
> its detection IS the guard's own predicate (`bake_selector_hit`, extracted from the refusal),
> so a translated entry can never still be refused for what it translated. The refusal names the
> real invocation. **(2) Endcap field selection is per KIND, matching the interior compiler
> (4.14).** `compile_cover.py` sent every non-setting entity down the character path and baked
> its `structured.invariants` VERBATIM into the prompt, while `assemble_prompt.py` prompts a
> motif/prop from `prose.rules` (or `render.bake`) and keeps invariants as QA keys only. A
> motif's invariants are often MEDIUM-SCOPED, statements about its own standalone plate form,
> so the leak was a register contradiction, not noise: winged-startup's "Plate register only:
> flat solid terracotta ground" lines were compiled into a warm-editorial cover prompt, and the
> two compilers disagreed about what the same canon meant. **(3) The `--no-text` runner report
> stops inviting false defects (4.14).** `render_cover.py --no-text` printed the same "BAKED
> TEXT (read every glyph back against these)" header over title lines that were deliberately
> NOT baked, so a closing plate's readback went looking for glyphs whose absence was the
> contract. The report now states the mode: art-only, any glyph in frame is a DEFECT, and the
> compiled lines apply only to a later typeset pass if the platform runs one. **(4) Pillow is
> declared where it is needed.** Every PIL-dependent skill script carries PEP 723 inline
> metadata (`# /// script` / `dependencies = ["pillow"]`), so `uv run <script>` resolves Pillow
> itself; before this, every readback invocation needed `uv run --with pillow` typed from
> memory, a tax the run paid on every single readback. The engine stays stdlib-only. Also filed,
> not built: G31 (nothing gates a scene whose prose positively demands what an in-frame
> entity's invariant forbids; the gate is a model judgement, not a lint, and its budget contract
> is a design decision).

> **v0.38 changelog - a real person's matrix is hyper-real neutral BY DEFAULT.** v0.37 built the
> register-neutral matrix and left it opt-in, so the next real-person entity (`david-kobrosky`,
> hyperagentic-age, 2026-08-08) was shot in-register ink-and-wash with a five-photo stack sitting
> beside it, and the operator had to catch it by eye. The rule is a porting asymmetry stated by
> Gary in that session: hyper-realism ports down into any register, a stylized reference cannot
> recover likeness. So `realPerson` + non-empty `photoStack` + no `registerNeutral` key now
> defaults the shoot to the hyper-real neutral medium and RECORDS the adopted declaration into
> canon (a default that is not recorded is re-derived forever); `registerNeutral: false` is the
> recorded opt-out that shoots a real person in-register deliberately, and it is never
> overridden. §12 REAL-PERSON DEFAULT. `realperson_default_neutral` in `matrix.py`; adopted and
> written back by `chain_matrix.build_plan`.

> **v0.37 changelog - the identity master could not be shot until a register existed, and it
> must be.** Paved out of Proof of Vibes (Russ Ballard's brand, 2026-08-06, subject consenting),
> whose architecture is one photoreal master with N register conversions derived from it. The
> shooter refused unconditionally on a null `identity.register.anchor`, and the two escapes beside
> it (`--register`, `--no-style-pack`) both choose WHICH anchor to pass, so neither could say
> none. That is an ordering deadlock: the register gates the master, and the master is exactly the
> artefact the register is later derived from. The framework's own vocabulary had held the concept
> since v0.21 (`face-neutral-color`, documented in `matrix.py` as "a full-colour, REGISTER-NEUTRAL
> face plate") and no code honoured it, so the universe wrote the rule into its own prompts.md and
> could obey it only by leaving the framework. `structured.registerNeutral` (§12) declares it in
> CANON rather than at the command line, because a flag cannot refuse a re-shoot it is not passed;
> neutral means NO ANCHOR IS PASSED rather than "an anchor is not required", so an anchor reaching

> **v0.43 changelog — the scene can contradict the plate, and the scene wins.** Paved out of
> the *The Next iPhone Moment* run (nation-of-fire, 2026-08-27). An entity was recoloured from
> gold to blue: its invariants said blue, its plates were re-shot blue, and 22 of 42 spreads
> still read "a warm gold volume of light" in their `scene`. Every one of them rendered GOLD.
> Fixing the entity and re-rendering produced the same gold, which is the part worth stating: a
> spread's `scene` is the INSTRUCTION and its plates are only CONDITIONING, so canon cannot
> correct prose that contradicts it. `audit_spec_refs.py` now reads the negative half of each
> cast entity's invariants (`...-never-gold`, `no-gold-anywhere`, `never-a-full-beard`) and
> warns when the scene asserts one anyway. It is a WARNING and not a refusal on purpose: one
> entity's `never-blue` is another's correct colour in the same frame, and a spread showing an
> orange kernel under a blue shell legitimately says "blue". So a phrase another cast entity
> POSITIVELY claims is never flagged. The first cut of this omitted that and fired 12 times on
> a clean spec, which is the failure mode §4 already names twice: a check that is wrong every
> time it fires trains its operator to ignore it. On the run that earned it, the narrowed
> version immediately found seven MORE spreads still calling an orange cube blue, plus a blunt
> find-and-replace that had recoloured a character's canonical gold pendant.

> **v0.33 changelog — three surfaces that each assumed a name meant a thing.** Paved out of
> the *An Amazing Sex Life* run (nation-of-fire, 2026-08-04). **(1)** No check may infer an
> entity's reference folder from its id (§3.5, id-is-not-the-folder). `audit_spec_refs.py`
> assumed `reference/<entity-id>/` and so could not see an entity whose art was deliberately
> re-foldered: it reported the Apostle as "being drawn from prose" four times in one book,
> on the same lines its own ref column listed ten of his plates. It reads the entity's
> declared paths now — sheets, alt-look sheets and anchor photos, contract slots, photo
> stack — and warns only when NONE of them arrived. Second instance of the class the caption
> check opened in v0.29: a check that is wrong every time it fires trains its operator to
> ignore it, and the true positive underneath is identical. **(2)** A byte copy is a
> transform and owns its recipe (§3.2). `render_cover.py` wrote `cover-raw.png` and stopped
> one step short of `cover.png`, so every book ended with a hand `cp` and then a
> `book-doctor` FAIL on `provenance cover.png` until the sidecar was hand-copied too; it
> publishes both now, byte-identical, with a `derived` recipe naming the raw and the raw's
> own recipe. The hand-copied sidecars on disk claim `asset: cover-raw.png` while sitting
> beside `cover.png`, which a generated one cannot. **(3)** A declared
> `identity.register.stylePack` binds the reference SHOOT (§4.7). Full mode was described
> from v0.12 and read by no compiler, so a universe could declare a pack, score for it in
> `universe-doctor`, and never shoot against it: nation-of-fire's seed for `the-sealed-spring`
> was shot against the inline anchor and came back fully PHOTOREAL, that register's own top
> rejected pole, on the same day its `stylePackNote` recorded two other renders returning
> the anchor's subject wholesale. A register declaring ONLY a pack now resolves from it
> (previously it could not shoot at all); a register declaring BOTH REFUSES at plan time and
> names both ways out. Backward compatible: the shoot default is unchanged for every universe
> that has not declared a pack, canon renders still read `identity.register.anchor`, and
> every addition is a new refusal or a new sidecar rather than a change to an existing
> contract.

> **v0.32 changelog — three compilers passed the same anchor and only two obeyed the same
> law.** Paved out of the *Why We Are the Luckiest Generation* run (nation-of-fire). **(1)**
> `compose-spread` now reads `identity.register.anchorSubject` and bans the anchor's own subject
> concretely on every spread, with the carve-out that a scene may ask for that subject BY NAME
> (§4.6, anchor-subject guard). It was the last of the three anchor-passing compilers not reading
> the field, which is the worst place for the hole because it handles every interior of every book;
> the gap had been FOUND AND FILED in this repo's own save log two days earlier and declined, and
> the next book paid for it by hand-negating an oil lamp and a clay jar in all 27 of its spreads.
> **(2)** A cast entry setting `pose: X` where the entity also declares `altLooks[X]`, without
> `look`, is now REFUSED (§4.6, pose-without-look refusal): the pose's bake described a capsule
> sheet the refs did not contain, so the render silently fell back to the default wardrobe and put
> a plain Latin cross on a character whose locked invariant forbids one. `allowPoseOnly` overrides.
> **(3)** A deterministic in-repo TRANSFORM now writes its own `.recipe.json`, a third honest way
> to get one beside generating and importing (§3.2): `conform_cover.py` produces the cover the
> platform actually ships and wrote no provenance, so `book-doctor` failed every book that ran it
> and two book runs hand-wrote the sidecar instead of fixing the tool. Backward compatible:
> universes conforming to 0.31 remain valid, and every addition is a new guard, a new refusal or a
> new sidecar rather than a change to an existing contract.

> **v0.31 changelog — the `visual-metaphor` was a second-class kind, and four surfaces
> proved it in one book run.** *What a Relief*, nation-of-fire, 2026-08-03. SPEC 12 has
> defined this kind since v0.4 as "a locked master plus `state` plates" and no tool could
> say either word, so the kind was authored by hand every time and the framework's own
> vocabulary was the thing in the way. **(1) `lock-shot` had no entry for `master`**, so a
> complete four-plate shoot filed the anchor into `contract.emptyPlates`, left
> `contract.turnaround` null, could never clear `setting_contract_gaps`, and sat at
> `status: unlocked` with no error anywhere; the repair was hand-editing the JSON to match a
> sibling that had been hand-edited the same way. Third instance of the alias defect class
> `scale` opened in v0.29: the word the spec and the scaffolder give the author is not the
> word the locker accepts. **(2) `chain_matrix` planned to REGENERATE a code-drawn
> blueprint**, overwriting a deterministic `abu elevation` output with an AI render and
> destroying the geometry seed the whole matrix is built on, which is the exact inverse of
> the blueprint-seeded chain this spec and `make-a-book` both prescribe. A shot whose
> recipe records a deterministic generator is now conditioning, never work, and it is
> passed to every shot automatically instead of being hand-wired into four prompts.md
> sections. **(3) There was no way to say "every state chains off the SEED, never off a
> sibling."** The cumulative chain is right for angles on one subject and wrong for states
> that differ in light: `--star` exists now, and `the-broken-cisterns`'s own authority.note
> had already recorded the same finding in prose one book earlier with no flag to act on.
> **(4) `add-entity visual-metaphor` scaffolded a SETTING** — room slots, a `houseRules`
> block for rooms an object does not have, and no `structured.sheets` at all, which is the
> one key the compiler resolves plates from. `--state` is repeatable now and emits the
> contract, the sheet keys, the pose selectors and a prompts.md whose prose is at level 3,
> because `chain_matrix` reads level-2 headings AS SHOTS.

> **v0.30 changelog — two checks that fired at the wrong time, both from one book run.** *He Is
> a Jealous God*, nation-of-fire, 2026-08-03. **(1)** A REFS selector could not condition a
> reference shoot on the entity's OWN already-made art, because `requiredForRender` named a plate
> the shoot was about to create and the existence check refused on it. The blueprint-seeded chain
> this spec prescribes for a multi-state object was therefore unreachable without temporarily
> rewriting `requiredForRender`, which is an author falsifying canon to satisfy a guard about
> something else. A required sheet not on disk yet is now DROPPED; an explicitly selected one still
> refuses, and dropping everything is still a refusal. **(2)** `lint-universe` now warns
> `LOCKED-BUT-NO-SHEETS`: a LOCKED entity whose art hangs off `contract` alone with no
> `structured.sheets` can have NO plate resolved for it, and it fails silently at compose time as
> `available: NONE` rather than at lock time. Eleven entities in one universe were in that state,
> including two heavily-used settings, all of them looking finished.

> **v0.29 changelog — five checks that were lying, all earned in one book run.** *The Tithe Is a
> Test* (nation-of-fire, shipped 2026-08-02) walked the whole chain and every defect it surfaced has
> the same shape: a surface that LOOKS like it is enforcing something and is not. **(1) The book
> doctor's caption check produced 29 of 29 false positives** because it compared a `_caption` (the
> words the reader reads) against `beats[].text` (instruction for the renderer), which are different
> documents by design in any universe that keeps a manuscript. It now reads
> `stories/<id>.manuscript.md` when there is one, and a check that fails on every spread of every
> book stops teaching its operator to ignore it (§3.5). **(2) `structured.render.qa` steered nothing
> and checked nothing.** §4.6 has stated since v0.4 that the checklist is the union of `invariants`
> and `render.qa`, and no compiler ever read the second half, so a six-item `render.qa` compiled to
> zero checks. Fifth instance of the v0.23-v0.28 defect class: a spec guarantee no code could
> deliver. **(3) A POSE may now supersede a base invariant** (§12), because an `altLook` is the wrong
> instrument when the face must not change and the only alternative was hand-wording "...except in
> pose X". **(4) `lock-shot` and `resolve_setting` disagreed about what `locked` means** for a
> setting, the promoter demanding the advisory `scalePlate` this spec explicitly says is advisory, so
> settings that legitimately cannot have one were hand-flipped in JSON. One predicate now,
> `setting_contract_gaps`, plus the `emptyPlatesExpected` count. **(5) `contract.blockingPlate` and
> `contract.dressing` leaked one book's props into every book reusing the setting**, and a reference
> image plus an injected contract sentence beat a per-spread negative that banned the prop by name,
> on three of seven spreads. Lint warns; a spread can scope the plate out. Also: `backfill-prompts`
> now SCAFFOLDS a missing `prompts.md`, since an entity older than the scaffolder had none and was
> invisible to the sweep, which left a locked, actively-cast character unable to be re-shot.
>
> **v0.29 same-day pave addendum (2026-08-02, the-bible-all-points-to-jesus run).** Four more
> members of the same "a check that lied or a silent foot-gun" class, found by six stewards in one
> book run and paved the same day. **(1)** `stories/*.voice-waivers.json` — voice-gate's own default
> waiver sidecar, which lives in stories/ — parsed as a StorySpec, so `validate` emitted a false
> "story missing 'id'" per waiver file (bit twice in one day). Sidecars are excluded by one shared
> predicate. **(2)** `structured.sheetAliases` (§12) lets an intentional add-keys-never-remove
> rename be DECLARED, so lint can tell it from a dead duplicate. **(3)** `chain_matrix` now honours
> `identity.register.anchorSubject` (see Register) instead of every matrix shoot hand-negating the
> anchor's subject in prompts.md. **(4)** ONE recipe per asset: `chain_matrix` used to write
> `<shot>.recipe.json` while the provider wrote `<shot>.png.recipe.json` — two provenance sidecars
> for one asset, free to diverge; the chain now merges its conditioning metadata into the provider's
> file and removes the stale twin.
>
> **v0.29 same-day pave addendum #2 (2026-08-02, eleventh-hour-heroes run).** **(1)** The cover
> compiler (`cover/compile_cover.py`) now auto-negates `identity.register.anchorSubject`, closing
> the last render path that passed the anchor first without reading the field: a cover render
> painted the readiness-lamp anchor's ancient burning oil lamp onto the cover wall (one paid
> re-roll). Skipped when `--anchor-ref` overrides the anchor, since the declared subject no longer
> describes the first reference (see Register). **(2)** `make-a-book` guidance: `allowUncast` does
> not protect anonymous crowds from the cast closure — a spread with unnamed figures must declare
> the per-spread `anonymous` field (two paid re-rolls); and after voice-gate blesses a manuscript,
> beat `text` syncs to the manuscript verbatim, because book-doctor's caption check makes
> beats == manuscript == captions the invariant (two runs did this sync by hand). **Recorded, not
> built:** `lock-level` grades a deliberately-trimmed character matrix as 'partial' forever
> because it grades against the canonical 8-slot matrix rather than the entity's declared sheets;
> advisory-only (assert-story unaffected), deliberately not landed mid-flight while sibling book
> sessions hold worktrees.

> **v0.28 changelog — lookbooks became real, and clothes got attached to people.** From v0.12 to
> v0.27 a Lookbook was a specification with no implementation: `--lookbook` wrote the vocabulary's
> NAME into the recipe after the image already existed, sampling nothing and gating nothing, and the
> engine held zero lines about lookbooks. Craft canon in two universes meanwhile instructed renderers
> to "pass `--lookbook X` so the renderer samples 2-4 exemplars, applies the varietyRule and gates
> the output" — three behaviours described, none implemented. Fifth instance of the v0.23-v0.26
> defect class: canon that is correct and unexecutable. v0.28 implements the consumption contract
> (§4.7.1), adds `always` / `appliesWhen` / `negatives` so a vocabulary can say WHEN it applies,
> validates lookbooks for real, and introduces `structured.wardrobe` (§4.7.2) so a CHARACTER binds
> their own clothes. Renders resolve wardrobe automatically off `--entity`; `abu wardrobe` answers
> the same question outside a render. Earned when two fully-locked characters turned out to have no
> wardrobe binding of any kind, and the one prose instruction that gestured at one pointed at a
> field that was `null`.

> **v0.27 changelog — a standard for when a REAL PERSON is reproducible.** `lock-level` answers
> "are the files on disk." It never answered the question a brand actually needs: is there enough
> coverage here to reproduce this person reliably, in a new pose, months from now, without their
> likeness drifting. The character matrix requires TWO shots. For an invented character that is
> defensible; for a real person it is not, and one session proved it — `gary` reached the required
> set early and his likeness still had to be rebuilt across five rerolls, nine photographs and a
> purpose-built chest-up plate before it held. §12 adds `REAL_PERSON_COVERAGE` and an advisory
> `real_person_gaps()`, which measures three things the old model could not express. **Angle
> coverage:** ≥6 varied photographs, because the rule "a single reference lets a face drift" lived
> in one universe's prose preamble, was right all day, and nothing enforced it —
> `realPerson.photoStack` accepted a single photo. **Expression coverage:** a stack carrying one
> expression reproduces one expression; the standard wants the face known at rest AND in use.
> **Context coverage,** the sharpest of the three: a character carrying a recurring prop needs one
> plate where that prop is LEGIBLE at render scale. Gary's pendant kept rendering wrong not for want
> of pendant references but because no plate showed it big enough to copy — in a head-to-toe frame
> it is about forty pixels. A matrix that only asks "which angles of the person" cannot ask that.
> Advisory throughout, exactly like `lock-level`: it never blocks a render, and an invented
> character is not measured against it at all.

> **v0.29 changelog — a setting may be `partOf` another setting.** Until now a setting carried
> exactly ONE flat contract: one `map`, one `blocking`, one `dressing`, one `scale`, for the whole
> entity. Correct for a shed, wrong for a house. `christofuturist-home` had grown to twelve plates
> covering nine rooms under a single room-agnostic `blocking`, and it had already cost the spec once:
> v0.13 added `contract.scalePlate` because "christofuturist-home, whose hearth room rendered small",
> a one-room problem that was unfixable on a nine-room entity and so became a new field for everyone.
> On 2026-08-02 it cost again. The sunken pit needed FIXED LETTERED SEATING (SEAT A / SEAT B) and
> there was nowhere to put it, since a `blocking` naming two seats would be a lie about the eight
> rooms that have none. The room was promoted to a top-level sibling, which lost the containment
> outright (nothing in the data said the pit is IN the home) and silently dropped the house rules,
> so `everyone-indoors-wears-the-house-slippers` had to be hand-copied onto the child.
>
> A setting now declares `partOf: <setting-id>`, and a parent declares
> `structured.houseRules: {invariants, dressing}`. THAT BLOCK ALONE is inherited: `invariants` union
> into the child (parent first, deduped) and `dressing` appends before the child's.
> **LAW inherits, ART never does.** `turnaround`, `blueprint`, `scalePlate`, `blockingPlate`,
> `emptyPlates`, `structured.sheets` and `contract.plates` are always the room's own, because
> inheriting a parent's plate would hand the model the hearth when it asked for the pit, which is
> the exact drift the feature exists to stop. `map`, `blocking` and `scale` stay the child's for the
> same reason.
>
> **Blind inheritance was implemented first and was wrong**, and it took ten minutes against real
> canon to prove it: folding the parent's whole invariant list into each child handed the pit
> `studyNook ONLY: EXACTLY TWO armchairs` and `hearthRotunda IS RETIRED`. Every setting invariant
> becomes a render-readback QA check, so the pit would have been graded on furniture it must not
> have. Hence the explicit opt-in. For the same reason `houseRules` accepts ONLY those two keys and
> REFUSES `always`/`qa` by name: both were in the first cut, both were verified dead on a real
> render (a setting's block is built from `contract`, its checks from `structured.invariants`), and
> a field that silently does nothing is the failure this spec keeps re-earning.
>
> Cycles, missing parents, non-setting parents and chains deeper than 8 are refused BY NAME at the
> gate rather than as a recursion traceback. Additive twice over: an entity with no `partOf`
> resolves byte-identically, and a parent with no `houseRules` gives its children nothing.

> **v0.26 changelog — `supersedes` now covers the negatives it always claimed to.** §12 has
> said since v0.10 that `supersedes` exists "so the QA checklist, the prompt block, AND THE
> COMPUTED NEGATIVES all agree by construction." For the negatives that was false from the moment
> v0.23 added `structured.negatives`: it shipped as a flat list, nothing was look-aware about it,
> and both consumers merged the whole list regardless of the selected look. Measured on
> christofuturism's `summer-quiet-luxury`, a look whose entire purpose is a BARE NECK: **32
> pendant-scoped negatives reached the model**, one of them literally `more than one necklace`,
> a negative that AFFIRMS a necklace is expected. The look survived only because a human hand-wrote
> an override sentence into the prompt body. `supersedes` now retires a negative by exact string
> exactly as it retires an invariant, via `Entity.look_negatives()`, honoured by both
> `compose-spread` and `shoot-references`; `altLooks.<key>.negatives` adds look-specific ones.
> Unrelated negatives survive, so superseding a pendant cannot disarm a beard rule. Fourth in a
> run of defects with one shape: the spec stated a guarantee and no code could deliver it.

> **v0.25 changelog — a shot can name WHICH of another entity's sheets it needs.**
> A shot's `REFS:` line took an entity id and nothing more, and the resolver passed that
> entity's `requiredForRender` set alone. So an entity's EXTRA sheets were unreachable from
> a shoot: a multi-angle `turnaround`, a worn/in-situ plate, a material variant could each be
> registered, carry full provenance, and be named by the entity's OWN `structured.render.always`
> instruction, and still no shot could ask for them. Proven on christofuturism's
> `north-star-cross`, whose fabrication spec warns in as many words that a single flat front
> view gets flattened back into an equilateral four-point star and that a multi-angle
> turnaround should be preferred. Three flat front plates were all the resolver could pass,
> and the pendant came back at 1.79:1 height-to-width against a spec of 1.24:1, reading as the
> crucifix the wearer's own invariant forbids by name. Now `REFS: <id>@<sheet>+<sheet>` names
> the sheets, they are passed FIRST, and `requiredForRender` still follows: **a selector may
> raise the ref set and must never lower it**, which is v0.24's lock rule one layer out. A
> selector naming a sheet the entity does not declare, or declares with no art, REFUSES.
> `--print-plan` now RESOLVES cross-entity refs instead of echoing them, and no longer hides
> them on the seed shot, so a typo costs nothing instead of costing a render. Two adjacent
> defects fixed in the same pass: a typed slot (`{"path","role"}`, v0.23) used as a cross-entity
> ref crashed the resolver, and a `Refuse` raised while shooting surfaced as a traceback rather
> than a message.

> **v0.24 changelog — a lock may raise a gate and must never lower one.** `lock-shot`
> recomputed `requiredForRender` from the KIND minimum alone, so any entity that legitimately
> required MORE than its kind demanded was silently demoted on its next lock. Proven on
> christofuturism's `north-star-cross`, a motif whose required set was `["hero","detail",
> "in-context"]` because that entity's own authority note records that ONE view of the mark
> reads as an equilateral star and only three views prove it is a cross: locking a new material
> plate rewrote it to `["hero"]`, so the entity guarding a filed trademark would have quietly
> stopped guarding it. Worse, the field that exists to rescue exactly this case,
> `requiredForRenderOnLock` (v0.11), REFUSED the key, because it validated names against the
> kind matrix alone and `in-context` is not a motif matrix shot. The escape hatch was closed
> against its own use case and the only way out was hand-editing the entity JSON, which is the
> hand-rolling the authoring module exists to remove. Now: a lock preserves any key the entity
> already required that still resolves on disk, and `requiredForRenderOnLock` accepts the kind's
> known shots PLUS the keys the entity actually declares. The typo check stays, so a key with
> neither art nor matrix membership is still refused, and a required key whose art is gone still
> drops. Found by a steward migrating a legacy brand OS, who worked around it by hand and flagged
> it rather than leaving it silent.

> **v0.23 changelog — a reference slot can say what it CONTRIBUTES, a negative can name one
> person, and a multi-line header stops being half-read.** §12 slots accept `{"path", "role"}`
> alongside the bare path they have always accepted, with roles `identity | geometry | garment |
> medium | scale`. A slot was previously `shot -> path` and nothing more, so nothing could declare
> "this plate supplies the cut of a garment, never its medium and never a face." That silence was
> not academic: a pair of watercolour-and-ink costume plates, whose own sidecars read "garment
> design ONLY; the render stays hyperreal", looked perfectly admissible as matrix slots on a
> HYPERREAL character and would have baked an illustrated medium into a photographic canon. The
> prose said the right thing and no gate could read it. The compiler now emits a per-ref
> `REFERENCE ROLES` instruction so a ref cannot contribute more than it should. Untyped slots emit
> nothing and are gated exactly as before, so no universe migrates. ALSO: `structured.negatives`
> on an entity, emitted ONLY when that entity is in frame. Six of nineteen banned-visual entries
> migrated out of a legacy brand OS name ONE person (no glasses on Gary, no black leather jacket,
> no stubble, no tattoos) while the same source explicitly PERMITS glasses on other people, so as
> flat pack `rejectedPoles` they would have forbidden those universe-wide and quietly overruled a
> decision the author had made the other way. AND a parser fix that cost a real render:
> `chain_matrix`'s `**Negatives (every shot):**` and `**Refs (every shot):**` headers were read
> with a single-line regex, so a header authored across four lines contributed only its first line
> and the rest was dropped in silence. On gary's first seed 5 of 18 negatives reached the model and
> `a crucifix` was among the thirteen discarded, so the pendant rendered as exactly the crucifix
> his invariant forbids by name. Both headers now read the whole block, splitting on commas or
> newlines and tolerating list markers. Same class as the header-implies-a-guarantee defects
> already fixed twice in that file.

> **v0.22 changelog — a character must be able to prove its own height, and so must an object.**
> §12 adds a `scale-plate` shot to the character and prop matrices (both `optional`), a `scale`
> descriptor for props, and a universe-level `identity.scaleReference`. v0.9 gave settings this and
> stated the reason in one line: *a plate cannot be judged on a dimension it does not depict.* That
> reasoning was never applied to people. `structured.scale` (v0.10) looks like it closes the gap and
> does not: its `height` is prose nothing depicts, and its `scalePlate` is explicitly a two-up of a
> PAIR at true relative height, so between them they answer "is he taller than her" and never "how
> tall is he." A `scale-plate` is a SOLO head-to-toe plate against a MEASURED reference whose real
> size is recorded, which makes the declared height checkable and gives the model an absolute unit
> for people and objects alike. The geometry is fixed by the framework and PROJECTED into §12 from
> `matrix.SCALE_PLATE_CONTRACT`, so it cannot drift; the treatment is the universe's, via
> `identity.scaleReference`, because "something tasteful" is register-local. `optional` rather than
> in `shots`, for the same reason `face-neutral-color` is: promoting it would demote every
> already-locked character in every universe. Advisory: `lint-universe` warns
> `CHARACTER-NO-SCALE-PLATE`, `CHARACTER-HEIGHT-UNDEPICTED`, `CHARACTER-SCALE-PLATE-MISSING`,
> `PROP-NO-SCALE`. Also in this release, three provenance defects found while migrating a legacy
> brand OS into a universe: `provenance.images()` swept `*.png` ONLY, so a `.jpg` photograph and a
> `.webp` pack ref were invisible to the sweep and could never be counted as missing, backfilled, or
> divergence-checked (it now sweeps `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`); `backfill-provenance` gains
> `--entity`, which `backfill-prompts` already had, so a one-character backfill is a reviewable diff
> instead of a whole-universe rewrite; and source classification now honours an EXPLICIT
> `realPerson.photoStack` declaration before the filename heuristic, because a photograph
> legitimately filling a matrix slot at `reference/<id>/face-neutral.png` matched neither `photo-N`
> nor a `photos/` parent and was stamped `attested`, asserting a render that never happened. Finally
> `abu list` shows lifecycle: an archived entity printed identically to an active one, so the listing
> invited a casting decision the entity had already been retired from. Earned 2026-08-01 on Gary's
> own entity, whose declared 6 ft existed only as prose.

> **v0.21 changelog — an asset from OUTSIDE arrives with its chain (`abu import-asset`), and the
> photo-stack rule stops existing twice.** Both additive: no universe migrates, and an asset already
> in canon is untouched.
>
> **(1) `import-asset`, and a fifth provenance class, `derived`.** A universe absorbs assets it did
> not generate: a retired brand repo is folded in, a blessed render is cut out of a product repo and
> installed as a photo-stack reference, a client hands over photographs. The framework had no verb
> for it, and every available path was a lie or a hand-roll. `backfill-provenance` can only classify
> an asset as `source` ("there is no generating call to record"), `reconstructed`, `attested`
> ("nothing about the generating call survives") or `deterministic`; for a CROP of a known
> gpt-image-2 render whose source hash, crop box and original prompt are all in hand, **all four are
> false**, and recording a knowable fact as unknowable is the failure that module exists to prevent,
> pointed the other way. The remaining option was writing the `.recipe.json` by hand, which is
> provenance saved by memory, which the provider adapter exists to abolish. §3.2 adds the class and

> provenance, and hand-written install copying. Three rules are load-bearing: every parameter is DATA
> and never a buried constant (two constants silently meaning different things sheared the descender

> **v0.12 changelog — text is gated, not banned.** §4.7 adds `textPolicy` to the Style Pack
> (`none` | `diegetic` | `furniture`). A blanket "no text" rule conflated three different things and

> **v0.10 changelog — a character must be able to prove its own scale, and its future.** The v0.9

> **v0.7 changelog — the cover-conform convention.** Added a normative default (§ producible-vs-surface

## 1. Why this exists

We have built ~15 illustrated books inside one shared universe (Nation of Fire). Each was strong, but
the *system* underneath was implicit and re-remembered every time: canon lived in prose, reference
art scattered across four different path conventions, craft rules survived as skill-file scar tissue,
and quality depended on the author holding it all in his head. The books were composable and
evolvable in spirit but not in mechanism — so the same failures recurred book after book (settings
that drift, references that silently go missing, beats that can't be traced to anything real).

The Agentic Brand Universe standard makes the implicit system explicit: a small set of primitives and
invariants that make a brand **universe** — version-controlled canon + golden assets — the
first-class object, deliverables **works** over it, references **load-bearing** (their absence
is a crash, not a drift), and quality a set of **wired gates** rather than a memory feat. It is
designed to be written and evolved primarily **by agents**, with the human in the loop exactly where
taste is irreducible. (An **Agentic Brand Universe** — the picture-book / comic — is one such deliverable.)

## 2. First principles (the bets)

1. **Universe-first.** The evolving canon is primary. A single work is a projection of it, and writes
   back into it. Composability and evolvability are then native, not bolted on.
2. **Canon is medium-neutral.** Canon entities carry no medium assumptions. Rendering into a medium
   (picture book, novel, script, comic, game bible) is a separate, pluggable layer. Ship one renderer
   first; add others without touching canon.
3. **References are load-bearing.** Every canon entity that has an asset (a character sheet, a setting
   plate, a voice sample) resolves to a real file or the build **fails loudly**. A reference you can
   forget is not a reference; it is a wish.
   - **3a. Self-containment.** A universe owns its assets *inside its own repo*. `assetRoot` resolves
     within the universe repo, and every referenced file lives under it — never in a sibling folder or
     another repo. The test: you can clone the universe repo alone and every reference still resolves,
     the gate still runs. Assets scattered across the folders that happen to *use* them is the drift
     this kills (the Nation of Fire canon began that way — 342 assets across 44 book folders — and was
     consolidated into one self-contained repo, 2026-07-18). A universe that cannot move as one folder
     is not yet a universe.
4. **Quality = taste × craft × truth.** Compelling output comes from three wired sources, never from
   the generator alone: (a) **human taste gates** at the irreducible moments; (b) **craft-canon** —
   narrative craft encoded as enforceable invariants; (c) **provenance** — beats grounded in real
   source material. All three are first-class, not optional passes.
5. **Evolution is version control.** Canon changes over time. Git is the evolution substrate: every
   canon mutation is a commit; contradictions are visible diffs; "what did the universe know on date
   X" is answerable. No bespoke versioning.
6. **Agent-writable by construction.** Every artifact is either structured data an agent can validate
   against a schema, or prose in a known slot. Nothing load-bearing lives only in a human's head or an
   unparseable blob.

## 3. The six layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  QUALITY      taste gates · craft-canon · read-back          │  (cross-cuts all)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  COMPOSER     agentic, per form: plan → compile → gate       │  §4.10
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  WORK         ONE made thing: this book, this flyer, a meme  │  §4.9
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FORM         what makes a work the KIND of thing it is      │  §4.8
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  GOLDENS      load-bearing resolver: entity → real asset     │  §4.4
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CANON        typed entities + relations; git-versioned      │  §4.1
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Read it bottom-up as a sentence: *canon* is what is true, *goldens* are what it looks like once
locked, a *form* is what shapes canon into a kind of thing, a *work* is canon given that form, and a
*composer* is the agent that makes one and answers to the gate.

The split that v0.6 introduced is between the middle two, and that much is durable: **a form is a
kind; a work is one made thing.** Conflating them is what made this standard storybook-shaped: the
one primitive that existed carried a story's required fields, so every deliverable had to be a story
to be expressible.

> **How these two middle layers are ENCODED is open, not settled.** From v0.6 to v0.16 a form and a
> work were typed documents executed by a single universal composer. That encoding is RETIRED
> (§4.8, §4.9): it was authored from one imagined example and produced zero works across the whole
> life of the framework. §4.8, §4.9 and §4.10 are now the record of what was retired and why, and
> they deliberately name no replacement until a second real composer exists to abstract from.
> Nothing at these two layers should be read as a live schema, here or there.

### 3.1 Canon (the universe)
The living graph. **Entities** (characters, settings, doctrines, motifs, beats, props, groups) and
**relations** between them (appears-in, derived-from, crossover-with, contradicts, supersedes). Each
entity carries **structured fields** (machine, load-bearing) and **prose fields** (voice, lore,
rules). Source of truth is the structured record; prose is a first-class field on it, not a separate
document that can drift.

### 3.2 Refs (load-bearing)
A resolver maps every entity to its real assets and **asserts** them before any render. Missing,
renamed, or unlocked → hard error. This is the layer that kills silent drift. (The Nation of Fire
`resolve_gabr.py` + `gabr-index.json` are the v0 of this layer.)

**The gate chooses its engine; it never assumes one (v0.60).** A universe's `canon/scripts/assert.sh`
runs the engine that is the first of `$AGENTICSTORY_ENGINE`, the path baked at `init`, and the
newest installed `abu` plugin (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/<version>/engine`, compared
numerically) whose `SPEC_VERSION` is at least `universe.json` `spec.version`. With none, it exits 3
naming every engine it tried and its spec version. `assert.sh engine` prints the choice. An engine
older than the pin cannot know the rules the universe relies on: it refuses a kind it has never
heard of, or passes a check it does not have, and both read as a verdict on canon. Earned
2026-10-06: continental-works pinned v0.58 while its gate ran an engine checkout at v0.51, silently
skipping every check added since, and the first `kit` record then failed there as "unknown craft
kind". The resolver is `scaffold.ENGINE_RESOLVER`; a universe whose `assert.sh` grew local modes
pastes it verbatim.

**A ref path may be a FILE or a DIRECTORY.** A directory expands to the image files directly inside
it, sorted. `agenticstory.refs.expand_ref` is the one implementation; `refs.photo_stack` layers the
`realPerson.photoLimit` cap on top of it (§12), and the cap applies AFTER expansion. A path that
does not resolve, or a directory holding no images, is a hard error rather than an empty list: a ref
that silently resolves to nothing is a silent downgrade to "invent it from prose".

**Every asset carries a `.recipe.json` sidecar, and there are exactly three honest ways to get one.**
The provider adapter writes one as a side effect of GENERATING. `abu import-asset` writes one as a
side effect of COPYING an asset in from outside. **A deterministic in-repo TRANSFORM writes one as a
side effect of transforming (v0.32)**, with `mode: "derive"`, a null `prompt`, a `model` that says no
model ran, and `derivedFrom` naming the source path, its own recipe and its hash. Nothing else writes
a recipe by hand.

That third way was missing and the gap fell on the most-seen asset in a book. `conform_cover.py`
turns the model's producible 2:3 render into the reader's 3:4 page, so `cover.png` is what the
platform actually ships and `cover-raw.png` is the render nobody looks at; only the raw got a recipe,
from the adapter. `book-doctor` therefore reported `provenance cover.png: no recipe.json beside the
asset` and FAILED every book that conformed a cover, and two book runs hand-wrote the missing file
rather than fixing the tool. A transform that produces a shipped asset owns its provenance, exactly
as a generator does.

**A byte copy is a transform, and the step that makes it owns its recipe too (v0.33).** The rule
above closed the hole one step upstream of where books were actually failing. `render_cover.py --out
.../cover-raw.png` left the conformed render and its recipe on disk and stopped; the staging layer
wants `cover.png`, so every book run finished with a hand `cp`, and `book-doctor` then failed on
`provenance cover.png` until the sidecar was hand-copied after it. Two mechanical lines, certain to
recur on every book, blocking the healthy verdict on a finished one. `render_cover.py` now PUBLISHES
the platform-facing name itself: any `--out <name>-raw.<ext>` also emits `<name>.<ext>` as a
byte-identical copy plus a `derived` recipe whose `derivedFrom` names the raw and the raw's own
recipe, so the chain back to the generation is unbroken and the two hashes provably agree. Nothing
else triggers, so `--out cover.png` behaves as it always did, and `--no-platform-copy` opts out. A
hand-copied sidecar could not have said any of this: the copies on disk claim
`asset: .../cover-raw.png` while sitting beside `cover.png`.

    abu import-asset <universe> <dest-rel> --from <src> \
      --from-repo <repo> --from-path <path-in-repo> --from-sha <sha> \
      --crop x0,y0,x1,y1 --source-generator gpt-image-2 --source-prompt-file <f> \
      --blessed-by "<who, when>"
    abu import-asset <universe> --manifest <manifest.json> --dest-dir <rel> [--prompts <f>]

**Provenance classes.** Four describe assets that were already here when the adapter arrived
(`source`, `reconstructed`, `attested`, `deterministic`; see `backfill-provenance`). The fifth,
**`derived` (v0.21), describes an asset that came from another repo as a stated transform of a known
asset**: `derivedFrom` names the source repo, path and hash, `transform` names what was done to the
bytes (a crop box), and `sourcePrompt` records the call that made the SOURCE, deliberately named so
nothing mistakes it for a call that produced these exact bytes. `derived` is NOT `unrecorded`: the
generating call is recorded, it simply happened elsewhere. **A `derived` import that cannot say what
it is derived FROM is refused**, because an import with no chain is not provenance; such an asset is
`--provenance source`, which claims only that it is an original input.

Manifest mode refuses the WHOLE batch before copying anything. Half an imported photo stack is worse
than none: the entity then declares a stack whose provenance is inconsistent, and nothing says which
half is which.

This exists because the alternatives were dishonest. Twelve blessed crops of known gpt-image-2
renders entered `christofuturism`'s `gary` photo stack on 2026-08-01. `backfill-provenance` would
have stamped each one `source` ("there is no generating call to record") when the source hash, the
crop box and the original prompt were all in hand.

### 3.3 Form (a kind of deliverable)
What makes a work the KIND of thing it is. A storybook, a flyer, a meme, a share card, an explanatory
plate and a slide deck are six forms over one canon; the canon does not change when the kind does.

*How* a form is written down is an open question rather than a settled contract. From v0.6 to v0.16
this standard answered it with a typed document — surface, required kinds, slots, generators,
invariants — and promised that defining a new kind of deliverable was filling that document in rather
than writing a renderer. That encoding is retired, and **§4.8 is now the record of its retirement,
not the specification of a live contract**. Until a second proven composer exists to abstract from, a
form is whatever a proven composer needs it to be, and no universe is asked to conform to a schema
this standard cannot yet justify.

### 3.4 Work (one made thing) and the composer (who makes it)
A **work** is one flyer, one book: canon given form. It names the kind of thing it is, selects the
canon entities it features, and carries **authorship** — decisions present in neither the canon nor
the form. It never mutates canon: a finished work *proposes* new canon back (a newly locked
character, a new crossover, a new doctrine occurrence) for the author to accept and commit (§5).

A **composer** (§4.10) is the agent that turns canon plus a form into the work, calling the
deterministic compiler (§4.6) and answering to the gate. It is **per form**, not one universal
executor: a storybook, a diptych series and a deck genuinely plan differently, and what they share
sits underneath the plan rather than inside it. What a work is encoded as, and which of a composer's
parts belong *under* it rather than *inside* it, are questions §4.9 and §4.10 hold open rather than
answer.

### 3.5 Quality (cross-cutting)
Three wired mechanisms, applied at defined points:
- **Taste gates** — human "that's it / that's not it" at irreducible moments (words-before-art,
  register-point, face-lock). The system's job: surface the *right* decision at the right time, never
  waste attention.
- **Craft-canon** — narrative craft as enforceable invariants attached to canon (spine shape, refrain
  presence, tension→turn, "awe not horror," show-don't-tell, the confusion-flag pass).
- **Provenance** — every beat cites a source (testimony, research, the author's own words). Unsourced
  vivid detail is flagged before it ships (the cross-person-contamination guard).

**Two delivery-side refusals (v0.20), both earned because they exited 0 and looked like success:**
- **`--out` is a file path, never a directory.** Handed a directory, the renderer's existence check
  is true for every spread, so `--skip-existing` reports "exists, skip" for the whole batch and
  renders nothing while still exiting 0. It now refuses and names the exact fix, and the check runs
  **before** the skip, or the skip still swallows the batch.
- **Captions must match the blessed manuscript verbatim.** A render-spec's `_caption` is copied from
  the blessed text when the spec is scaffolded and nothing re-syncs it, so editing that text
  afterwards leaves the art following the new words and the caption keeping the old. The book doctor
  compares every caption against the blessed source and fails on any drift. **Its limit is stated
  deliberately:** it compares two artifacts, so it cannot see prose that is stale in BOTH, which is
  exactly what an entity recast produces (§4.3). Earned 2026-08-01, where it correctly passed all 73
  captions of a book whose story still described the room it had left.
  - **WHICH source is the blessed one (v0.29).** When `stories/<id>.manuscript.md` exists it is the
    source, and `beats[].text` is the source only when it does not. These are different documents on
    purpose: a beat's `text` is **instruction for the renderer** ("Theo sitting on the bench beside
    Jerry, telling him about the baptism") while a `_caption` is **the words the reader reads** ("It
    had been a year since he stood at the back of the room"). Comparing the two therefore fails on
    every spread of every book in any universe that keeps a manuscript, which is what happened: 29 of
    29 verbatim-correct captions were reported stale on *The Tithe Is a Test* (2026-08-02). **A check
    that fails on every spread of every book trains its operator to ignore it**, which costs more
    than never having written it. The defect the check exists for survives the change, because the
    manuscript is what gets rewritten.
  - Three manuscript conventions are parsed (`**7.**`, `**Spread 7**:`, `### 7`), a wholly-italic
    line is treated as stage direction rather than caption, and comparison normalises whitespace,
    emphasis and typographic punctuation. Every one of those normalisations exists to prevent a
    false positive; a caption that is a SUBSTRING of its beat passes, because one beat set across two
    spreads is legitimate and a wholesale stale caption is neither equal nor contained.
  - **The endcap naming rule is a PAIR, not a list.** A spread id is the closing plate if it is one
    of the known names or carries `closing` as a word (`closing-plate`, `plate-closing`,
    `spread-30-closing`). The fixed list contradicted itself: an unrecognised id was demanded at
    landscape interior aspect by one check and at portrait endcap aspect by another, so no file could
    satisfy both and the only escape was renaming the spec id.

**AN ENTITY'S ID IS NOT A PROMISE ABOUT WHERE ITS ART LIVES (v0.33).** No check may infer an
entity's reference folder from its id; it reads the paths the entity itself declares
(`structured.sheets`, every `altLooks.<key>` anchorPhoto and sheet, the `contract` slots, a
realPerson `photoStack`), and only the id when the entity declares no path at all. `reference/<id>/`
is a scaffolder's default, not a contract: `add-character` puts the folder there and canon is free
to point anywhere afterwards, which universes do deliberately (nation-of-fire keeps every plate of
`apostle-lee` under `reference/apostle-delmar-lee-coward-jr/` by written universe law: one folder,
one man). `audit_spec_refs.py` assumed the default and so reported "casts `apostle-lee` but NO
reference image from `reference/apostle-lee/` was passed... it is being drawn from prose" four times
in one book, on the same lines where its own ref column listed ten of his plates. Same rule as the
caption check above: **a check that is wrong every time it fires trains its operator to ignore it**,
and this one is otherwise load-bearing, because the true positive it exists to catch — a cast entity
whose plates never reach the model — reads identically.

**A prompt guard that fires is also a read-back assertion (v0.48).** The standing prompt
guards (device anatomy, readable surface, travel direction, vehicle seat facing, two-hander
staging, seated anatomy, no UI chrome) are appended to the prompt when its content calls for
them, and each is an instruction to the model. An instruction is weighed against everything else
in the window and loses some fraction of the time, and until v0.48 nothing checked the output for
the thing the guard asked for: the pack gate never mentioned devices, and a render with a screen
on the wrong side of its laptop passed read-back because no line told the reader to look. Now
`READBACK_GATE` in `prompt_guards.py` carries one assertion per guard name, `generate.py` writes
`guards` (the names that fired) and `guardGate` (their assertions) into the recipe, and the
readback of that render is the pack gate PLUS the entity gate PLUS the guard gate. A guard with
no gate entry fails the provider's own test suite, so the two halves cannot drift apart. The
prompt half asks; the gate half refuses.

**A GATE NOBODY JUDGED IS NOT A GATE (v0.49).** v0.48 put the assertion in the recipe so a
reader would be told to look. It gave nobody a way to tell whether the reader looked, so a
skipped gate and a passed gate were indistinguishable from outside, which is the same
failure one level up: "evaluate every guardGate entry" is an instruction, and an
instruction loses some fraction of the time. So the verdict is RECORDED, beside the image,
as `<image>.readback.json`:

    {"guardVerdicts": {"device-anatomy": {"verdict": "pass"},
                       "no-ui-chrome":   {"verdict": "defect", "why": "invented menu bar"}}}

`verify_render.py` REFUSES any render whose recipe names a fired guard with no recorded
verdict, and prints that guard's assertion so the reader is told where to look rather than
merely told they failed. A `defect` is a failure, not a note: the rule is regenerate from
scratch. A `waived` verdict is the recorded exception and REQUIRES a written reason, the
same shape as a voice-gate waiver and `--waive-entity`; a waiver with no reason is a skip
with better manners. Three refusals guard the record itself: a verdict filed under a guard
that never fired (a typo must not read as a judgement, leaving the real guard unjudged), an
unknown verdict word, and one verdict spread across a batch (a verdict is a statement about
ONE picture, and letting one look cover four is the failure the gate exists to stop). A
render that tripped no guard is untouched, and a recipe carrying `guards` with no
`guardGate` (written before v0.48) still demands verdicts, because the guard NAMES are the
checkable half. `<image>.readback.json` is a build artifact and never ships, like the
recipe beside it, and since v0.50 the universe scaffolder's `.gitignore` says so: the
SPEC had asserted it never ships while nothing ignored it, which left every universe one
`git add -A` from committing a run's judgements into canon. The recipe is the opposite case
and is deliberately NOT ignored, because provenance IS canon.

**AND IT HAS NO OFF SWITCH, WHICH IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT (v0.50).** The check
is default-on and a `waived` verdict with a written reason is the only escape. A flag to skip
it was proposed and DECLINED, because nobody could name the caller that would need one: a
flag added before there is a real caller exists to be found by the next person in a hurry
and used to silence the gate, which is the failure the recorded verdict was built to close.
It is written down here so that absence reads as a choice and nobody adds the flag back
believing it was forgotten.

**A GOLDEN NOBODY LOOKED AT IS NOT A GOLDEN, AND A TAP IS WHAT LOOKING MEANS (v0.50).**
`shoot-references` has carried a rule since it was written: no shot locks until a human has
actually seen it, because reading an image back yourself is QA and not delivery. It was prose,
and prose does not bind, so an agent could crop-zoom forty renders, pass every invariant, lock
them all, and the person who commissioned the work had seen nothing. The skill's own map named
the open half precisely -- *"the blocker is not effort, it is a definition: what COUNTS as
shown"* -- and that definition is now settled: **a tap on an `AskUserQuestion` card** (Gary,
2026-09-14). It is the one surface where a decision reaches the operator as tappable options
rather than prose, and a reference shot is exactly the case where the options ARE the artifact,
so **the board carries a `preview` on every option**.

The record is the sidecar v0.49 already established, one file per image, with two independent
records inside it:

    {"guardVerdicts": {...},
     "seen": {"board": {"id": "...", "shownOn": "...", "question": "...",
                        "options": ["keep", "reroll"], "labels": ["Keep", "Re-roll"],
                        "digest": "8f0f..."},
              "verdict": "keep", "on": "...", "digest": "8f0f..."}}

`shoot-references`'s `shot_board.py board <png> ...` composes the board AND stamps every shot
in it as shown; `shot_board.py tap <png> --verdict keep` records what came back; and
`lock_shot` -- the function, so every caller inherits it, exactly as the file-existence refusal
does -- REFUSES a shot whose sidecar carries no approving verdict. Its carve-out is the same
one: a relative path with no root resolves to nowhere, and refusing it would break every caller
that locks symbolically.

**A preview costs the visible `Other` row**, because it flips the tool into a side-by-side
layout that does not draw that row at all. So the off-list answer -- something else is wrong,
canon needs changing, stop the shoot -- is written into the question TEXT, where no layout can
drop it, and it is appended by the composer rather than by whoever calls it, because a rule
that fires only when remembered is the prose this whole mechanism replaces.

**Five refusals, each one a way the record could otherwise be forged:**

- **A verdict for a shot that was never on a board.** The same shape as v0.49's refusal of a
  verdict filed under a guard that never fired: the command looks like it worked and the shot
  stays unseen.
- **A verdict the board did not offer.** A board stores the verdict TOKENS and, separately, the
  LABELS the operator read, because they differ by design (a card reading "Re-roll" records
  `reroll`) and comparing one against the other refuses a legitimate tap for a spelling nobody
  chose.
- **`reroll` or `waived` with no written reason.** Same shape as a voice-gate waiver,
  `--waive-entity`, and a waived guard. `waived` is the recorded exception for an operator who
  is genuinely absent, and it is never a board option, because a waiver is by definition not a
  tap.
- **Bytes that changed between the board and the tap, or between the tap and the lock.** A
  re-roll writes the new picture at the SAME path, so without this the operator's yes to the old
  one silently approves art nobody has looked at. The verdict is about the bytes they saw.
- **A `reroll` verdict at lock time.** The operator turned it down; regenerate from scratch with
  the defect named, never lock what was refused.

A board is chunked at four questions, because that is the tool's limit, so a nine-shot matrix
returns three boards rather than a truncated one. And showing a picture again clears any earlier
verdict on it: the old yes was about the old look at it.

**AND THE BOARD MUST CARRY THE PICTURE, NOT ITS PATH (v0.51).** v0.50 closed the question it
set out to close and left one half open, which `shoot-references`' own map recorded rather
than letting the closed question read as complete: *"whether the board should carry the
picture itself rather than its path. The preview is text."* It is. An `AskUserQuestion`
preview carries the shot's path and the entity's invariants and it **cannot carry the
image**. So the record proved a tap on a card NAMING a file and proved nothing about whether
the art was ever in front of anyone. Left there it is worse than no gate at all: it refuses
to lock art nobody tapped, which reads as rigour, while training the operator to tap through
a list of filenames.

**THE DISCRIMINATOR IS GENERAL, AND IT IS THE PART WORTH REMEMBERING.** A decision the
operator can answer FROM WORDS stays an `AskUserQuestion` card in the terminal: it is faster
there, and a web page for a yes/no spends their attention for nothing. **A decision that
requires SEEING the thing goes to a frapp** — a Freedom app, a small page served off the
operator's own machine, behind a token, reachable from their phone over their own tailnet.
Shot approval is the first and clearest case, because it is not answerable from a filename.
Any future gate in this spec that asks a human to judge an ARTIFACT inherits the same rule.

**IT REMOVES THE UNVERIFIABLE STEP RATHER THAN PATCHING IT.** A viewer opened on the render
machine would have to be DRIVEN by the agent and then ATTESTED to, which is the same
unchecked claim one level along: an agent that says it opened a window is exactly as
checkable as an agent that says the operator looked. In a frapp **the thing that serves the
image is the thing that records the tap**. The browser asks for the bytes, the bytes go out,
the page writes `served` with their digest from inside that response, and the verdict comes
back over the same connection. An agent has no way to call that truthfully about a picture no
browser requested. It also goes where the OPERATOR is rather than where the render happened,
which is the failure `shoot-references` earned on 2026-07-30 when ten images were reported
opened onto a screen the operator was nowhere near.

So the board record gains a channel, and the sidecar gains one field:

    "board": {"id": "...", "options": ["keep", "reroll"], "digest": "8f0f...",
              "display": {"channel": "frapp", "served": true, "servedOn": "...",
                          "digest": "8f0f...", "url": "/shot/0"}}

`shot_board.py board` resolves the channel, stamps every board with it, and on the frapp
channel STARTS the page and prints the link to send the operator. `shot_board.py served` is
called by the page, never by an agent. `record_tap` REFUSES `keep` on a frapp board that
never served, and `seen_problem` refuses it again at lock time, because the first check is
the verb and the second catches a hand-edited sidecar. `reroll` is deliberately exempt —
turning art down is the safe direction and refusing it would trap the operator — and `waived`
is exempt because a waiver is by definition not a look.

**NOTHING OF THE FRAPP LIBRARY IS VENDORED.** The token gate, the tailnet route, the journal,
the secure-origin refusal and the design system are Freedom's, shipped in `freedom-frapp.mjs`;
ABU resolves the newest INSTALLED copy at start, exactly as a scaffolded frapp does, and
never a versioned cache path, which is the import that dies at the next plugin update. A copy
would fork and diverge inside a month. The page is `skills/shoot-references/frapps/
shot-board.mjs`, it holds no state, and its queue is derived per request from the sidecars,
so a verdict recorded from the terminal disappears from it by itself.

**THE DEGRADE IS HONEST, WHICH MEANS THE TWO RECORDS DO NOT LOOK ALIKE.** ABU runs on
machines that are not this one. With no `node` or no Freedom install there is no frapp, and
the board falls back to the text card — the same cards v0.50 shipped, previews and all. What
it must never do is produce a record that reads like the real thing, because that is this
whole gate's own failure mode one level along. So an approval taken on the card channel
carries its own key:

    "seen": {"verdict": "keep",
             "unshown": {"channel": "card", "why": "no Freedom install on this machine..."}}

It LOCKS. Refusing it would make ABU unusable anywhere but one machine, which is a worse
answer than a weaker record honestly labelled. But `unshown` is greppable, `shot_board.py
status` prints it beside every shot, `tap` prints it the moment it is recorded, and the
sentence says what the verdict is: a tap on a card naming a file. A frapp that fails to START
degrades the same way, carrying the start failure as its reason, so a wedged port never
leaves a board claiming a channel that showed nothing.

**WHAT THE FRAPP CHANNEL PROVES, EXACTLY.** That the picture's bytes were delivered to the
browser the verdict came from, at a named moment, hashed and tied to the board. It does not
prove a human looked at the screen, and nothing can: eyes are not addressable. The claim is
deliberately small and deliberately true, and the sentence after it is the honest one — this
is the strongest thing a machine can know about a look, and it is strictly stronger than a
filename.

**A CONTACT SHEET THAT DOES NOT COVER ITS BATCH IS A LIE (v0.49).** `shoot-references`'s
SHOW THE OPERATOR EVERY SHOT gate told its reader that `contact_sheet.py` "already refuses a
partial one, so a short sheet cannot read as everything I rendered". The script refused a
file that did not EXIST and had no idea what the batch was, so a sheet built from three of
twelve renders was built happily and read, to the person looking at it, as twelve.
`contact_sheet.py --cover <dir>` names the batch: every `*.png` in that directory that is
not a sheet or a parked candidate must be on the sheet or the build REFUSES and names what
is absent. It is opt-in, because a deliberate subset is a legitimate sheet; what was wrong
was a documented refusal that no code performed.

**Binding an entity inherits its guard (v0.46).** A render made with `--entity` already
carried the entity's `structured.invariants` into the PROMPT as positives. It did not carry
them onto the checklist the OUTPUT is read back against: the pack's `gate` was the whole
gate, and an entity's own law was checked only if somebody remembered to run
`render-readback` by hand. Since v0.46 `generate.py` writes `entityGate` into the recipe,
one entry per bound entity that has invariants (`{id, look, invariants}`), and the readback
of that render is the pack gate PLUS every entity gate. A wrapper that prints a checklist
(`make-piece` in a universe) prints both; a confirm that records a verdict records it against
both. The defect that earned it, 2026-09-10: four album covers rendered the North Star Cross
with drifted proportions, and the printed checklist never mentioned proportions, because the
only place "bottom point 1.48 times the others" lived was the entity, and the entity's guard
never reached the render's gate. The prompt half inherited; the judgment half did not, and
the judgment half is where drift gets caught.

### 3.5.1 Measured read-back: the properties an eye cannot hold (v0.40)

A taste gate answers *is this right*. It cannot answer *is this 1:8 or 1:6.5*, *is this screen
coarser than the one we blessed*, or *how far off-target is that blue* — and a register whose whole
argument is a MEDIUM ("this is a printed sheet", "this is woven", "this is a plate on a press") has
properties that are numbers. Those are the properties that regress silently, because a look is
reviewed by eye and a pitch is invisible by eye at any size a person reviews at.

`render-readback/scripts/measure.py` is the ruler, and it has four modes:

| mode | answers | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `figure` | head-to-body ratio | an operator-supplied `--chin` (see §12; it resists automation) |
| `periodic` | the fundamental period of a repeating screen, as `dotsAcrossWidth` | `--patch` |
| `patch` | mean colour of a region and its distance from a target | `--patch`, optional `--target` |
| `extent` | how far a FEATURE runs, how continuous, how many (v0.42) | `--feature` |

**Three rules, and each one is a defect that was paid for.**

1. **A NUMBER ALONE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT.** Every mode emits its METHOD and its landmarks or its
   patch alongside the result, and writes them beside the image as `<image>.measure.json`. Three
   sessions once hand-rolled three head-to-body rulers that disagreed, and nobody could tell whether
   a plate had improved or the method had changed. `periodic` and `patch` therefore **require**
   `--patch` in fractional frame coordinates and there is no default, because a default would
   silently make two runs incomparable while looking like one method.
2. **A CONFIDENT WRONG NUMBER IS WORSE THAN A REFUSAL.** Every mode validates its own result and
   raises rather than returning nonsense. `periodic` refuses a flat patch, a patch at full ink
   coverage (a halftone at solid has no dots left to measure, which is a true and useful thing to be
   told), and a peak ladder in which nothing has a harmonic.
3. **THE FUNDAMENTAL IS THE SMALLEST PEAK THAT HAS A HARMONIC.** A screen peaks at p, 2p, 3p, and on
   a rotated screen the harmonic is routinely louder, so taking the strongest peak reports 2p and
   halves the dot count; taking the first peak latches onto a single-pixel resampling artefact. Both
   were tried and both were wrong. The full ladder is recorded either way, because it is the evidence
   that reconciles two measurements disagreeing by an integer factor.

**The record is keyed by KIND** (`{"periodic": {...}, "patch": {...}}`). One plate legitimately
carries several measurements; the original flat shape deleted the previous one without saying so.

#### `extent`: the ruler a FEATURE needs (v0.42)

`periodic` and `patch` describe what the SHEET is made of. Neither can answer how far one thing ON
it runs. **Any gate phrased as a length or a count is an extent claim** — "no longer than about a
sixth of the frame width", "one short broken stretch", "one place only, not repeated across a
field", "does not reach the edge" — and every one of them was judged by eye until this existed.

`extent` takes a **PREDICATE** where the other two take a patch, and records it for the same reason:
an extent is a statement about what you counted as the feature, and two runs under different
predicates are not comparable however alike the numbers look. `warm-chroma`, the first predicate,
scores each pixel `max(a*, b*, 0)` in CIELAB: gold is +b\*, rose is +a\*, and a cool ink is negative
in both, so an accent ink separates from a cool ground with no per-plate fitting.

It reports, per connected region, the bounding box and area as frame fractions, the **extent along
the region's own principal axis** (a fringe tracing a cloud edge is diagonal, so a bbox width
understates it and a bbox diagonal overstates it), the peak chroma, and **`occupancy`**: the
fraction of bins along that axis carrying pixels. Occupancy is the half of the claim that is not
length. A continuous drawn line approaches 1.0 and a broken dotty stretch falls well below it, which
is what lets a gate refuse a SHORT stretch that came back smooth and saturated.

Two parameters change what question is being asked, so both are recorded. **`--blur`** merges a
halftone screen into the region an eye actually reads; at 0 the accent ink is thousands of separate
dots and "how far does it run" is answered per DOT. **`--bridge`** merges separated stretches within
a stated radius into one region, because a dotty fringe running down one cloud edge arrives as
several stretches that a viewer plainly reads as one line; area and occupancy are always computed
from the UNBRIDGED mask, so bridging can never claim ink that is not on the sheet.

**Three refusals, and the first one is the whole product.** Three predicates were tried against real
plates before `warm-chroma` and all three scored the sheet rather than the feature on it: distance
off the canonical paper-to-ink axis (which ranked the most-fringed plate LOWEST, because a saturated
plate's own ink is not the canonical ink), the same axis fitted per plate (halftone dot edges are
partial coverage and do not travel it in sRGB), and the same again in linear light where coverage IS
linear (still wrong, because these sheets are not one ink; the blue itself drifts in hue across the
frame). So: it refuses a frame with **no cool ground** for a warm feature to depart from; it refuses
when the mask covers more than **25%** of the frame, which is a description of the ground rather
than of a feature on it; and it refuses a largest region **touching the frame edge**, whose extent
is a lower bound rather than a measurement, unless `--allow-clipped` says to record it as one.

**Finding NO feature is a measurement, not a refusal.** A plate carrying no such feature has no
extent, and reporting `regions: 0` is the correct answer. The pack that earned this ruler has
exactly that control in it: one ref with no prismatic treatment at all, which must stay measurable.

**The defect that earned it (proof-of-vibes, 2026-08-20).** A Style Pack's fringe assertion failed
its own round-trip twice, on two different ref sets, both calls made by eye and in prose and
therefore not comparable to each other. Measured afterwards, the pack's blessed refs ran 0.077 to
0.274 of frame width while the plates rejected as drawn rainbows ran 0.456 to 0.696 — a gap with
nothing in it — and the second round-trip, rejected twice, measured 0.150, inside the blessed band
on run length, peak chroma and occupancy alike. **The gate had been stricter than the plates its
own pack was built from, and no eye was going to discover that.** A cap re-derived from measured
blessed evidence is the fix; the ruler is what makes "re-derived from evidence" mean anything.

**Where this belongs in a pipeline:** a Style Pack gate assertion (§4.7) that names an exact
`measure.py` invocation and a numeric bound is CHECKABLE, where the same assertion in prose is a
vibe. Reach for it whenever a register's argument rests on a number — a screen ruling, a weave
count, a paper colour, a line weight, an ink density.

```
**Entity kinds, and the two the backtest forced in:**
- For a **setting**, `structured` carries the *contract*: `{ turnaround, emptyPlates[], blueprint, map,
  blocking, dressing }` — all required before any spread in that location renders. A null contract
  field means **unlocked** and the resolver refuses to render it. (Environment load-bearing fix; §6.)
  **`blueprint` SHOULD be a code-built 3D MASSING RENDER shot from the setting's own locked cameras**
  (v0.15, advisory): `abu massing <spec.json> --out .../blueprint.png`. A top-down plan still
  validates, but it forces the image model to infer the perspective, which is where room proportion
  and handedness drift. Keep the massing sheet crude on purpose so it reads as scaffolding, and pass
  it with the standard blueprint guard: layout reference only, never painted.
- **`visual-metaphor`** (backtest finding 2) is a first-class kind: the central object a whole book
  zooms into and argues through — *Hold It Up to Forever*'s locked scale, *Maximize*'s bazaar of
  cages. It carries a setting-style contract (a locked master + derived element crops) because, like a
  setting, every page depends on it — but it is the book's *spine-object*, not merely a location.
- **`realPerson`** is a sub-block on a `character`, not a flag (backtest finding 4): real-subject books
  (Brenda, Russ, Nait, Panama, Apostle Lee) need the photo stack, approval state, sensitive list,
  activity-wardrobe eras, and exact group counts — the multi-ref rule, the subject-approval gate, and
  the group-lineup lesson all live here.

### 4.1.1 Reference implementation: when the element already exists as something other than prose (v0.57)

A motif, prop, visual-metaphor (or any entity) that a site component, a §4.11 generator or a
locked render ALREADY DRAWS is defined by that implementation. Its prose is a lossy summary,
and a new surface drawn from the summary is a reinterpretation, not the element.

```jsonc
"structured": {
  "implementation": {
    "kind": "component",                          // component | generator | asset | none
    "repo": "freedom-site",                       // optional: a sibling repo's folder name
    "path": "components/home/Continent.tsx",      // what draws it (a generator's id for `generator`)
    "compareAgainst": "reference/continent/live-original.png",  // an image of the live original
    "note": "import it, port it, or render it and use the output"
  }
}
```

- **`component`**: code in a site or app. `compareAgainst` is REQUIRED (`validate`), because it
  is the only thing that lets a reviewer tell a reuse from a reinterpretation. Capture it from
  the shipping surface, not from a redraw.
- **`generator`**: a generator in this universe (§4.11); `path` is its id or `generators/<id>`.
- **`asset`**: a locked render or file that IS the element; it is its own original.
- **`none`**: no implementation exists yet, and `reason` says so. This is the ONLY honest state
  for a prose-only element; the absence of the field says nothing.

**THE REUSE RULE.** Work that shows an element with an implementation REUSES it: import or
extract the component, run the generator, or pass the locked render as a reference. It never
regenerates the element from its description. Whatever is made is then COMPARED against
`compareAgainst` side by side before it ships. Where a painted medium genuinely has to depict the
element (an illustration that contains the site, say), the original is the reference, never the
prose.

**What enforces it.** `Entity.referenceable_sheets()` offers the original under the key
`implementation`, so every consumer that asks the engine what it may pass for an entity
(`compose-spec`, `shoot-references`' chaining) is handed it without knowing the field exists.
`on-brand-image --entity` passes it FIRST among that entity's refs, writes the comparison into
the prompt and the recipe as an entity invariant (so `render-readback` checks it), prints a note
when the implementation is code, and refuses when the original is missing on disk.
`lint-universe` errors `IMPLEMENTATION-MISSING` when a pointer names a file that is not there (a
path in a sibling `repo` is checked only when that repo is checked out beside the universe), and
warns `MOTIF-PROSE-ONLY` when a motif, prop or visual-metaphor that a story, render-spec or work
uses has neither a locked render on disk nor an implementation, including one that declares
`none`, since that element is drawn from its description on every use.

**Earned 2026-09-29 on continental-works.** The "continent" (a mosaic of tiles each carrying a
geometric figure, with multi-stripe ribbons threading up through the gutters between tile
columns) was canon only as a sentence, "a tile = a seat, dim vs lit". An agent building a new
surface from that sentence produced flat seat squares beside the ribbon. Gary, with a screenshot
of the live site: "This is what i meant by team squares dawg notice how the ribbons relate to
it." The component that renders it on the live site was the definition all along.

### 4.2 Relation
```jsonc
{ "from": "jerry-man", "rel": "crossover-with", "to": "brenda-gentry", "story": "gold-belongs-to-god", "note": "…" }
```
Relations are their own records so the graph is queryable ("every crossover Jerry is in", "every
story that touches this doctrine") and so contradictions/supersessions are explicit.

**A side may name ANOTHER universe as `<universe>:<id>` (v0.56).** A copied entity's most
important fact is where it came from (`{"from": "freedom-character", "rel": "derived-from", "to":
"nof-universe:the-wingman"}`), and a side resolved only inside one universe, so two universes
wrote that provenance into prose rather than fake a local stub. A foreign side is well-formed but
unresolvable: `validate` accepts it when the sibling universe (the directory beside this one) is not
on disk, and CHECKS it when it is, reporting a source that has moved or gone. `abu relations <u>
<universe>:<id>` lists what derives from it.

### 4.3 Story Spec
```jsonc
{
  "id": "not-every-fire-is-holy",
  "logline": "…",
  "spine": "obedient-servant",             // the arc invariant this story must satisfy —
                                           // obedient-servant | thesis | primer | testimony | ...
                                           // NOT every story is a hero-journey (backtest finding 1):
                                           // An Honest Primer on AI is a "primer" spine; Hold It Up
                                           // to Forever is a "thesis" spine built on a visual-metaphor.
  "refrain": "Not every fire is holy.",
  "register": {                            // the paint-language (backtest finding 3) — a first-class
    "id": "warm-oil-curdles-cold",         // per-story renderer config, not implicit in the renderer
    "anchor": "reference/style-anchor.png",// content-neutral palette/finish swatch, passed first
    "anchoredToRealArt": null,             // e.g. Painted in His Image anchors to Tadeo's own canvases
    "rejectedPoles": ["washed-out/mushy", "famous-artist pastiche"]
  },
  "features": ["jerry-man", "brenda-gentry", "anjali-sambalu", "wally-boone", "wisp", "the-fear-thing"],
  "beats": [ { "n": 1, "text": "…", "location": null, "characters": ["jerry-man"], "provenance": "…" } ],
  "writesBack": [ { "kind": "character", "id": "anjali-sambalu", "locked": true } ],
  "gates": { "wordsBlessed": "2026-07-15", "subjectApproval": "gated:brenda-gentry" }
}
```

**Spine (finding 1):** the NoF canon's claim that *every* property is an obedient-servant journey is
not actually true — *An Honest Primer on AI* is an explainer, not a hero-journey. `spine` is a
per-story **declared** invariant drawn from an open set (`obedient-servant`, `thesis`, `primer`,
`testimony`, …); craft-canon checks a story against *its declared* spine, never a single assumed one.

**Story status (`stub` | `full`):** a story may be registered as a `stub` (title + declared spine,
no beats yet) so the canon reflects the whole roster before every book is fully migrated — the
features/beats/provenance requirements apply only to a `full` story. (Mirrors a setting being
`unlocked`.)

**Register (finding 3):** the paint-language is a first-class per-story renderer config, sometimes
anchored to a real artist's own body of work (*Painted in His Image* → Tadeo's canvases). It is
locked via register experiments (Gary points), then passed as a content-neutral **style anchor** on
every render — never left implicit inside the renderer.

**Recasting (v0.20):** replacing one canon entity with another across a whole story is a
distinct operation from editing a spread, and it is a **manuscript event rather than a data
edit**. `recast-story` swaps every structural reference it can prove (beats' `location` and
`characters`, `features`, `writesBack`, and the render-spec's `setting` and `cast[].id`), and
**refuses an unregistered entity**, because a recast must land on real canon. It **flags any
`plate` the new entity does not declare** and never substitutes one: plate keys are per-entity
(`master`/`empty` versus `wide`/`close-jerry`), so a swapped setting silently keeps a camera that
no longer exists, and the compiler then refuses much later with no hint why. **A swap must never
guess a camera.**

It deliberately does NOT decide which prose went stale. It emits a review packet (both entities'
self-descriptions plus every beat) for a reader, per §3.5's taste-gate principle and the
role-not-a-service pattern of slot judging. Two word-list heuristics were built and discarded:
sweeping the old entity's contract buried the true hits under character names and under negations
the entity states about itself ("no brand marks"), and subtracting the new entity's vocabulary left
ordinary discursive words, because `prose.rules` is English and furniture nouns are a tiny subset
of it. A sweep a human learns to ignore is worse than no sweep. Earned 2026-08-01 on
*Will There Be Ice Cream*, where two blanket string replacements left a `spineNote` citing the
replaced character's origin book, `aimDiscipline` pointing at pre-renumber beat numbers, and five
beats still describing a counter, a stool, a bowl and a spoon beneath finished paintings of a park
bench and two ice cream cones.

### 4.4 Ref contract (the resolver)
- `resolve(entity) → real paths | error`
- `resolve-setting(location) → contract paths | error (if unlocked/missing)`
- `assert-spread(characters[], location?) → ok | non-zero exit listing what's missing`
- **Invariant:** no renderer may generate a unit whose `assert` has not passed.

### 4.5 Renderer interface (superseded by §4.10; invariants retained)

**v0.6:** what this section called a *renderer* is now a **composer** (§4.10). The rename matters
because "renderer" implies a deterministic template engine, and the layer that plans a work is not
one. This section also once claimed a *story spec* had become an instance of the generic deliverable
primitive; §4.9 retracts that, because it never happened. **§4.3 remains canonical for stories.**
Three invariants from this section survive unchanged and remain normative for a composer:

- It declares `consumes` (which entity fields it reads) and `produces` (medium artifacts).
- It **must assert refs before every unit** (§4.4). No unit is generated whose `assert` has not passed.
- It **never mutates canon.** It reads canon plus the story or work it is making, and emits medium
  output plus a `writesBack` proposal for the author to accept.

### 4.6 Prompt compiler (the render step)
`assert-spread` guarantees the refs *exist*; it says nothing about the **prompt**. Left to a human or
LLM, the prompt is retyped every render and any rule not recalled in that moment is silently dropped
— the single highest-frequency defect class (earned 2026-07-18: a hand-written prompt omitted a
character's canon-declared front patches and invented an age, across a whole batch). The compiler
removes that step.

- **Contract:** `compile(spread-spec, preamble) → (prompt, refs[], qa[])`, pure and deterministic.
  A *spread-spec* is thin — `{ setting:{entity,sheet?}, characters:[{entity,pose}], extras:[{entity,bake?,sheet?}], scene }` — the only free text is the scene *action*. Everything identity-bearing is compiled from canon:
  - refs = each entity's `requiredForRender` + the pose's `render.poses[pose].sheets` (de-duped);
  - prompt = `preamble.register` + setting bake (the setting's `contract.dressing` + book rule) + each character's `render.always` + `render.poses[pose].bake` + extra bakes + `scene` + `preamble.negatives`;
  - qa = the union of every in-frame entity's `invariants` + `render.qa` — **the checklist is compiled from the same canon as the prompt**, so read-back can never check the wrong things (the second half of the earned failure: the QA checklist was also hand-written and never checked the missing patches).
    **`render.qa` was finally implemented in v0.29.** This line has stated the union since v0.4 and
    no compiler ever read the second half of it, so an entity could carry a well-written
    `structured.render.qa`, validate, lint clean, and contribute ZERO lines to the checklist. Earned
    on `theo-doorchaser` (2026-08-02), six qa items and an empty `invariants`: a dry assemble
    reported thirteen QA invariants on a two-hander (all thirteen the other man's) and zero on the
    spread where he stands alone, and his half-on jacket was the spine of the book. Compiled for
    every kind, look-aware (an alt look may replace the render block wholesale), and de-duped against
    `invariants`. `lint-universe` additionally warns `ENTITY-QA-WITHOUT-INVARIANTS`, because
    `invariants` is what the identity bake guard, auto-disambiguation, `supersedes` and `judge-slot`
    read: an entity guarded only by `render.qa` is guarded in one place out of five.
- **The retired-dialect migrator (v0.39).** In the retired NoF `compile_render.py` dialect, `bake`
  SELECTED which locked state reference was passed; in this compiler `bake` is free prose and the
  selector is `plate` (non-characters) / `pose` (characters). The assembler REFUSES a bake that is
  really a selector (a bare slug naming one of the entity's own sheets or poses), and
  `compose-spread/scripts/migrate_render_spec.py translate <universe> <spec> [--write]` converts a
  whole spec out of the dialect: dry-run by default, previous bytes kept beside the spec, and its
  detection is the refusal's own predicate (`bake_selector_hit`), so a translated entry cannot
  still be refused for what it translated. Earned twice before it shipped: `looked-like-hate`
  (2026-07-31) rendered a three-state spine object with zero of its locked plates, and
  `takeoff-thursdays` (2026-08) hand-rolled the same translation as declared debt while the refusal
  named a migrator that did not exist.
- **Provider-agnostic:** the compiler emits `(prompt, refs, size)` and hands off to a swappable
  provider adapter (`gpt-image-2` today, others behind the same interface). The adapter normalizes the
  *call*; per-provider reference-conditioning and moderation (e.g. a `public-figure` block) remain
  provider facts, not framework facts.
- **Determinism ceiling (invariant):** the compiler makes the *input* deterministic; the model output
  stays stochastic. A compiled prompt is necessary, not sufficient — the read-back gate (§3.5) is
  still mandatory, and a drift-prone shape is guaranteed by *passing its reference image*, never by
  wording it harder.

- **Normative guards (v0.8, extended v0.19).** Rules the compiler emits or enforces on every job,
  because each is a property of *how the compiler works*, not of what a given book contains. A
  universe that writes these into each book's style text will drop them the one time it forgets.
  Guards divide into two kinds. An **unconditional** guard is emitted on every render (anchor-style,
  single-image). A **conditional** guard is emitted only when the SCENE TEXT shows the defect is in
  reach, detected by a `_has_*`/`_in_*` predicate beside it (motion, addressing, bedclothes); this
  keeps the prompt from filling with rules irrelevant to the beat, at the cost of a detector that
  must itself be tested against real scenes.
  **A conditional guard's detector is the part that fails.** Written narrowly it is silent on the
  very case that earned it: the addressing detector's first version matched the phrase `at a
  pulpit` and missed a scene reading `at a plain pulpit`, which was the exact spread that prompted
  the guard. Prefer the bare noun, accept some noise, and PROVE the guard fires on the defective
  scene before believing it.
  **The list below is asserted by a test** (`GuardsDocumentedTest`): every `*_GUARD` constant in
  `assemble_prompt.py` must be named here, because this section already drifted once when
  `MOTION_GUARD` shipped 2026-07-28 and was never documented.
  - **Hands guard (v0.35).** Fires when the scene text puts a hand, finger, thumb, wrist or a
    hand verb (holding, pointing, reaching, writing, clasped) anywhere in the picture. It states
    the count out loud: exactly four fingers and one thumb per hand, exactly two hands per person,
    two nearby hands staying separate rather than fusing into one mass, each hand joined to a
    believable wrist and forearm, sized to its owner, and making real contact with the thing it
    rests ON. Earned 2026-08-05 across one book: a man's two hands merged into a six-fingered mass
    on the table, and a hand on a trellis came back with an extra digit, a wire-thin wrist and its
    palm pressed on the brick beside the wood rather than the wood. Hands are the most reliable
    hallucination in this pipeline and the only one a reader spots instantly, so the guard states
    the anatomy as a count rather than asking for "correct hands".
  - **Eye-contact guard (v0.38, `EYE_CONTACT_GUARD`).** Fires when the scene text has people
    engaging each other or an agent directly (`_has_conversation()`: talking, laughing with,
    introducing, showing, presenting, gesturing at, toasting, greeting), and states that everyone
    in a conversation looks AT the person they are talking with, gazes actually meeting; nobody
    looks at the camera and nobody stares into the middle distance unless the scene text directs
    a gaze somewhere by name. A scene that explicitly hands the camera the interlocutor's role
    ("facing the viewer", "the reader is the person he is meeting") is the carve-out and skips
    the guard entirely. Earned 2026-08-08 on the-introducer spreads 05, 08 and 10 in a single
    batch: a man mid-decision at his laptop, a man gesturing at a wall, and a founder laughing
    over her shoulder all rendered with eyes on the LENS, because a warm grin toward camera is
    the model's strongest prior for a likeable subject. The operator's words are the rule: "if
    the camera is not representing your interlocutor's eyes, why are you looking at it?" The
    readback half lives in `render-readback`: a conversation scene where a participant's eyes
    are on the camera or the middle distance is a DEFECT to re-roll from scratch.
  - **Neck-rotation guard (v0.38, `NECK_ROTATION_GUARD`).** Fires when a scene asks a figure to
    look somewhere behind their body (`_has_look_back()`: looks back, glancing back, over his/her
    shoulder, face turned back …). It states the anatomy: a head turns at most about sixty degrees
    past the shoulder line, so a person looking behind themselves rotates SHOULDERS AND CHEST with
    the head or stops and turns around; the chin stays near the shoulder it turns toward and the
    face never points opposite the chest. It also names the two legal resolutions (pause the
    figure with the upper body genuinely rotated, or settle for a modest sideways glance), because
    a ban without a resolution invites the opposite defect. Earned 2026-08-08 on the-introducer
    spread 03 ('his face turned back over the street' rendered chin-past-shoulder on a climbing
    torso; operator: 'why are you distorting yourself like an exorcist?'). The motion case of
    make-a-book's torso-follows-head rule.
  - **Door guard (v0.38, `DOOR_GUARD`).** Fires when a scene has a door AND someone engaging it
    (`_has_door_interaction()`: knob, handle, reaches for, walks through, threshold, ajar …). It
    states American door mechanics as checkable numbers that must hold at once: leaf about 3 ft by
    80 in (half an adult's standing height wide, taller than everyone), knob or lever at waist
    height 36-40 in and inset a hand's width from the edge OPPOSITE the hinges, the leaf inside a
    visible frame, the person gripping at their own waist with a bent elbow, and a swing the hinge
    and handle sides make physically possible. Scenery doors nobody touches do not fire it.
    Earned 2026-08-08 on the-introducer spread 07: a knob at thigh height jammed against the jamb
    edge on a leaf too narrow for the man reaching for it ("think about how american doors work").
    Doors are the hands of architecture: familiar enough that every error is instantly visible,
    with a prior loose enough that the model errs constantly.
  - **Subject-presence guard (`SUBJECT_PRESENCE_GUARD`).** Fires when a scene BOTH names a
    person as its subject AND carries an instruction pushing people to be distant, small, out
    of focus or unrecognisable (`_subject_vs_background_conflict()`). It scopes the anonymity
    instruction to INCIDENTAL BACKGROUND people, states that an empty room or empty chair is a
    DEFECT rather than a tasteful reading of the rule, and then names the resolution instead of
    only the ban: anonymity is achieved by CAMERA AND FRAMING — from behind, in profile,
    cropped at the shoulders, by the hands — never by removing the person.
    It fires on the CONFLICT and not on either cue alone, because an anonymity line on an
    unpeopled scene is fine and a person-subject with no anonymity line is fine. It is the pair
    that deletes people.
    Earned 2026-08-28 on a Nation of Fire book, where seven spreads carried both lines and two
    came back as beautiful EMPTY ROOMS: a hall of screens with nobody arguing in front of it,
    and a study with an empty chair where a man was meant to be explaining himself to a laptop.
    The two instructions look unrelated when written and are in direct conflict when read, and
    the model resolves that the cheapest way available — render the room, omit the person.
    Nothing errored; both renders were competent; only a human looking at the pictures caught it.
  - **Laptop-form guard (`LAPTOP_FORM_GUARD`).** Fires whenever a laptop is DRAWN AT ALL
    (`_has_laptop()`), which is deliberately wider than the device-use guard above: that one
    needs a person operating the thing, while this failure is anatomical rather than
    behavioural, and an empty room of laptops gets the geometry wrong just as readily as one
    somebody is typing on. It states the form — exactly two parts and exactly ONE base, the
    keyboard deck extending TOWARD THE VIEWER, the screen rising from the back edge, and
    nothing whatsoever behind the screen — and then gives the renderer an instruction for the
    case it cannot satisfy: where many laptops repeat into the distance, only the nearest few
    are drawn as laptops and the rest dissolve into haze and points of light, because a
    malformed laptop is worse than no laptop.
    Earned 2026-08-28 on a Nation of Fire cover, a field of laptops receding to a horizon.
    Every machine came back with TWO bases, a deck in front of the screen and a second slab
    behind it, and the far ranks were half-remembered shapes on plinths. The scene text had
    said "a screen standing up from the FAR edge of that base", which never states WHICH SIDE
    the deck extends; the model drew one on each side and was not wrong to. The prompt was
    ambiguous, not the renderer, which is the shape of most guards in this table.
    It lives in the framework rather than in one book because the laptop is the single most
    drawn object across these universes: `hyperagentic-age`'s central motif IS
    `supercharged-laptop`, and every article hero on eleven wikis passes it through
    `on-brand-image`. A per-book fix would have left all of them wrong.
  - **Device-use guard (v0.38, `DEVICE_USE_GUARD`).** Fires when the scene pairs a screened-device
    noun with a use signal (`_has_device_use()`: typing, at the keys, reading the screen, working
    at, sits at the …). It states the physics: a device someone is USING faces its user, screen to
    their eyes and keyboard under their hands, and a screen rotated toward the camera while its
    user types blind is a defect. It then names the resolution rather than only the ban: when the
    screen's content must reach the VIEWER too, the correct camera is OVER THE USER'S SHOULDER,
    which is legal and encouraged. Earned 2026-08-08 on the-introducer spread 05, which failed
    both ways in one day: the first roll hid the screen from the viewer, and the correction rotated
    the laptop toward the lens so the man was typing on a keyboard he could not see. A device
    merely PRESENT (sitting on a desk, beside an empty chair) does not fire the guard.
  - **Anchor-style guard.** Whenever a register anchor is passed, the prompt states that ref[0] is a
    style sample only: match its medium, brushwork, palette and light, take NO subject from it. The
    anchor leads every render, so on a spread that casts no setting and no characters it is one of
    only two references and the model reads it as CONTENT. A pure-vision beat came back as a room
    full of period strangers holding the anchor's own props. Every other spread survived only
    because setting plates and character sheets outweighed it, which is why this looked safe for
    months.
  - **Anchor-subject guard** (v0.32). When the register declares `identity.register.anchorSubject`,
    the prompt additionally names what the anchor DEPICTS and bans it specifically, on every render,
    with one carve-out: content the scene description asks for BY NAME is still allowed. The generic
    anchor-style guard above is not sufficient on its own, because a general negative loses to a
    concrete picture: an oil-lamp anchor put its own lamp and clay jar onto a spread that was already
    carrying eight references, simply because the scene contained a table. `anchorSubject` was added
    for exactly that and was then read by only two of the three compilers that pass an anchor first
    (`chain_matrix.py` since v0.29, `compile_cover.py` after a lamp was painted onto a finished
    cover). The interior compiler was the last one blind to it, which is the worst place for the
    hole: it handles every spread of every book. The cost was silent and paid per book, one book
    hand-writing "no ancient oil lamp, no clay oil jar or flask, no terracotta oil vessel" into all
    27 of its spreads' negatives and recording that in its authoring notes as a quirk of the book.
    A universe whose own cartridge asserted "the compiler injects the negation" was describing a
    retired local fork, and nothing checked the claim. Suppressed when a spread or book sets
    `anchorRef`, because an override replaces the image passed first and the declared subject no
    longer describes it.
  - **Single-image guard.** Emitted by default: one continuous full-bleed image, never a grid,
    contact sheet, comic page or panelled study. Canon legitimately supplies multi-panel references
    (a character turnaround, a visual-metaphor's states sheet) and the model copies their layout.
    `allowMultiPanel` (book- or spread-level) opts out.
  - **Motion guard** (conditional; v0.15). When a scene has someone moving toward something, the
    destination must be AHEAD of them in frame and they are seen from behind, because a face toward
    the lens means they are walking away from everything behind them. Earned where a man "stepping
    toward the door" rendered walking at the camera with the lit doorway behind him, so the picture
    said the opposite of the beat.
  - **Addressing guard** (conditional; v0.19). When one person addresses a group, the prompt states
    the two legal cameras: either the camera is among the audience (backs of heads near, speaker
    beyond facing us) or at the speaker (his back to us, audience beyond facing us). The audience is
    never arrayed behind the speaker. Earned three times in one book: a congregation seated facing
    the back wall of its own church, a vote taken at that back wall, and a preacher at a pulpit with
    his congregation blurred BEHIND him. This is a COMPOSITION prior rather than a facing prior, so
    `FACING_TOKENS` cannot neutralise it and naming the camera does not help; the model satisfies the
    camera and then places the people by cliche.
  - **Bedclothes guard** (conditional; v0.19). Someone asleep, waking or getting out of bed wears
    nightclothes, not a suit, with an explicit exception for a scene that states the person is
    dressed. Earned where three spreads put a man in a business suit and necktie in his own bed,
    because his canon asserted a default outfit and canon prose outranks whatever a scene leaves
    unsaid. Fixing the entity was not enough: ANY character with a stated default outfit is put to
    bed in it, in any universe.
  - **Bed-length guard** (conditional; v0.20). When a person is lying on a bed, the bed is drawn
    at true adult length, head at the pillow and feet reaching most of the way down, with the
    footboard beyond the feet rather than at the hips or knees. Earned where an old man lay in a
    bed whose foot reached his waist, leaving nowhere for his legs. The model composes the
    reclining figure to fill the frame and then fits the furniture around the part it drew, so
    the bed gets truncated to whatever the visible body needed. Distinct from the bedclothes
    guard, which fires on bed + a SLEEP signal and governs what the person WEARS; this fires on
    bed + a LYING signal and governs how long the BED is.
  - **Crowd-member guard** (conditional; v0.20). A named character seated inside an audience
    faces the same way everyone around them faces and holds the same posture; if the scene needs
    their face, the CAMERA moves rather than the person. Earned where a book's subject sat in a
    seminar audience and was rotated three-quarters to the lens while every other listener faced
    the speaker, so he alone appeared to be looking away from her. This is the mirror of the
    addressing guard: that one governs geometry BETWEEN a speaker and a crowd, this one governs a
    character INSIDE one, where the pull is not composition cliche but the model's preference for
    showing a protagonist's face, which it satisfies by turning the body instead of the camera.
    Its detector deliberately excludes bare "seated in" / "sits in", which describe the crowd
    itself and fired it on speaker scenes it has nothing to say about.
  - **Uncast-character refusal.** Before any spend, the compiler matches every character entity's
    given name against the scene text and REFUSES on any name it does not cast, because the model
    invents a confident stranger for each. An over-the-shoulder single needs both people cast: the
    shoulder is a person. `allowUncast` overrides when the mention is genuinely not in frame. Name
    tokens already covered by a cast entity do not fire (`chief-of-*` and `apostle-*` ids share a
    head token).
  - **Pose-without-look refusal** (v0.32). Before any spend, a cast entry setting `pose: X` on an
    entity that ALSO declares `structured.altLooks[X]`, without setting `look`, is REFUSED.
    `pose` selects a render block; `look` is what resolves the alt look, and therefore what passes
    that look's own sheets and applies its `dropSheets`. When both are keyed the same, which is how
    every wardrobe capsule is wired, setting only `pose` assembles cleanly and renders the entity's
    DEFAULT wardrobe: the pose's bake says "matching FIGURE 2 FROM THE LEFT on the supplied capsule
    reference sheet" while that capsule sheet is not among the refs at all, so the model is told to
    match a picture it has never been shown. Earned where seven spreads cast a character in a
    knitwear look with no `look` key and two were paid for before a crop-zoom found the render had
    fallen back to his default jewellery, violating a locked invariant the unread sheet exists to
    hold. `allowPoseOnly` on the cast entry overrides, for the rare beat that genuinely wants the
    default look's body under a named pose.
  - **Per-spread preamble override.** A book may carry more than one visual register when the change
    is DIEGETIC. A spread may override `style`, `negatives`, `guardedNegatives`, `anchorRef`, `size`,
    `allowMultiPanel` and `allowUncast`; anything it does not name falls back to the book preamble.
    The alternative (a second render-spec per register) duplicates the whole preamble and drifts the
    moment one copy is edited. The universe's `rejectedPoles` are identity and are never shed by a
    spread override.
- **Reference impl:** the framework's own `skills/compose-spread/scripts/assemble_prompt.py`, with
  tests. Superseded 2026-07-25: v0.5 named `nof-universe/canon/scripts/compile_render.py` here, and
  sanctioning a universe-local compiler is how the two implementations diverged into disjoint
  feature sets — the fork held the four guards above while the framework held alt-looks,
  auto-disambiguation, guarded negatives and `anchorRef`, and neither could see the other's. A
  universe-local compiler is now a FORK to be migrated, never a sanctioned pattern.

### 4.6.1 The prompt budget (v0.41)

The image provider hard-rejects a prompt over **32,000 characters** with a 400. That prompt
is not authored anywhere: the compiler assembles it from the register line, then EVERY cast
entity's `render.always` prose, `invariants` and `negatives`, then the setting, the scene and
the spread's own negatives, plus the auto-appended guards. So its length is an emergent
property of the cast, and it grows every time any entity in that cast gains a rule.

**`render_spread` now REFUSES above the cap before spending, and reports the count on every
run.** The number it reports is the length WITH THE PROVIDER'S STANDING GUARDS APPLIED, which
is what actually gets sent: `apply_prompt_guards` appends up to seven blocks after the compiler
hands off, several thousand characters on a busy spread. Measuring the pre-guard string
under-reports, and a budget check that is believed and wrong is worse than none: on the day
this shipped, a spread whose dry run said 26,325/32,000 assembled 32,308 and failed anyway. `--dry-run` prints `prompt <n>/32000`, and any run at 90% or more prints a warning.
The refusal names the fix, because the fix is always the same: a rule belongs on the ENTITY
once, not restated in each spread that casts it.

Earned 2026-08-21 (nation-of-fire, *The Deal Composer*). Three spreads 400'd in one session.
Each had passed `--dry-run` first, because the dry run reported refs and QA-invariant counts
and never the one number that decides whether the paid run can succeed. Each then burned
three attempts and two retry backoffs before surfacing the provider's message.

**A negatives list is a BUDGET, not a changelog.** This is the pressure that fills the cap.
Every defect tempts an author to append a negative and nothing removes one when the design it
defended against is retired, so the list grows monotonically and is re-sent on every render
that casts the entity. `lint-universe` warns `ENTITY-NEGATIVES-BLOATED` at 60 entries. It is
a warning and not a refusal because only the author knows which entries are still live.

The second failure is the expensive one and it is about quality, not budget: **dead negatives
dilute live ones.** Measured on `the-wingman` the same day: 100 negatives, of which 39
defended against a retired mascot design, a retired palette and a retired body shape that no
longer appeared anywhere in its conditioning chain, while the rule that failed on roughly
every other render (a mouth on a mouthless creature) held 8 slots among the hundred. Pruning
to 48 addressed both problems at once.

**A failed render must not leave a plausible artifact.** `render_spread` deletes any existing
output file and its recipe before the attempt loop. The loop's own `out.exists()` check is
correct for the current process, but a stale file already at that path survives a total
failure, so any caller that checks "does the file exist" or "is it a reasonable size" reads a
400 as a success. In the session above, three spreads 400'd, left three unrelated older
images at those paths, and were reviewed as if they were the new renders.

**...but a re-roll of good art must not lose it either.** Since SPEC v0.44 the previous output is
MOVED ASIDE rather than deleted: `render_spread` renames `<out>` to `<out>.prev` (and the
recipe to `<out>.recipe.json.prev`) before the attempt loop, unlinks both on success, and on
total failure LEAVES them and says so on stderr. It never restores `.prev` to `<out>`, so the
stale-reads-as-new hazard above is unchanged: `<out>` is still absent after a failed run, and
every existence and size check still reads that failure correctly. The `.prev` suffix keeps
the file out of any `spread-*.png` glob. Accepting the old picture is a deliberate manual
rename, never something the tool does on the operator's behalf. Earned 2026-08-28, when a
48-spread book re-rolled two already-good spreads, the provider dropped all three attempts on
each, and both images were destroyed with nothing to fall back on.

### 4.7 Style Pack (the portable look)

A **Style Pack** is a self-contained folder that defines ONE look and is consumable **without a
universe**. It is the register's paint-language (§3.5, glossary) extracted into a portable artifact so
that generating an on-brand image needs only *a style*, never a canon. This is the layer that makes
the framework useful for the common case — "here is a folder of images, make more that look like
them" — which has no recurring-identity requirement and therefore no need for entities.

```
<pack>/
  pack.json         # the manifest (below)
  refs/*.png        # 3-8 style reference images: the load-bearing source of the look
```

```jsonc
{
  "id": "anthropic-plate",
  "name": "Anthropic ink-line plate",
  "anchor": "refs/hands-blocks.png",          // the one ref always passed FIRST
  "refs": ["refs/hands-blocks.png", "..."],   // 3-8, pack-relative; a subject-matched one is chosen per render
  "palette": { "ground": ["#CC785C","#F5F1E9","#B9C7BA","#C9C3DE"], "fill": ["#F5F1E9"], "line": ["#1A1A17"] },
  "styleLine": "single-weight wobbly black ink brush line, flat cream fills, flat solid ground, face-on",
  "rejectedPoles": ["neon","3D/CGI/Pixar","perspective","isometric","shading","gradients","coloured linework","any text"],
  "gate": [                                    // read-back assertions, checked against the OUTPUT
    "single-weight wobbly black ink line only, no coloured linework",
    "flat cream fills; no shading, gradients, or painterly texture",
    "ground is one flat pack-palette colour",
    "<= 4 elements, generous negative space",
    "NO text, letters, or numbers anywhere",   // because textPolicy is "none"
    "any hands are loopy and non-anatomical (this look has no realistic finger-count to get wrong)"
  ],
  "maxElements": 4,
  "textPolicy": "none",                        // none | diegetic | furniture (v0.12)
  "requiredEntities": ["north-star-cross"]     // OPTIONAL (v0.45): canon ids a render MUST bind
}
```

- **Consumed two ways.** (a) **Quick mode** — the `on-brand-image` skill takes a pack path + a scene
  and generates + reads-back, no `universe.json` in sight. (b) **Full mode** — a `register` MAY set
  `stylePack: "<id-or-path>"` to source its `anchor` + `rejectedPoles` from a pack instead of inlining
  them, so a universe's canon renders and a one-off image share ONE definition of the look. Registers
  that inline their anchor stay valid; the field is additive.
- **...and binds the RENDER too (v0.54).** `compose-spread` and `cover` refused a register with a
  `stylePack` and no inline `anchor` ("identity.register.anchor is null") while the shooter shot it,
  so a universe could lock its matrix and render nothing (gap G22). Every tool now reads the
  register through ONE resolver, `agenticstory.register`: an inline `anchor` wins; otherwise the
  pack's `anchor`, `rejectedPoles` and `anchorSubject` apply, with any inline `rejectedPoles` /
  `anchorSubject` still winning over the pack's.
- **A declared `stylePack` binds the reference SHOOT (v0.33).** Full mode was described here from
  v0.12 and read by no compiler: `universe-doctor` scored whether the path resolved, and nothing
  consumed it, so a universe could declare a pack, score for it, and never once shoot against it.
  `shoot-references` (`chain_matrix.py`) now resolves the register in three cases.

  | register declares | a shoot uses |
  |---|---|
  | `stylePack`, no inline `anchor` | the PACK — this is full mode, finally implemented |
  | `anchor` only | the inline anchor, exactly as before |
  | BOTH | **REFUSES at plan time**, naming both and the two ways out |

  The refusal exists because the two are different pictures and only the author knows which is
  wanted. `nation-of-fire` declares both, and its own `stylePackNote` says the pack exists BECAUSE
  the inline anchor has a SUBJECT that comes back wholesale on a sparse render, naming two failures
  on 2026-08-04 where it did. A third followed that day: a seed shot against the inline anchor
  returned fully PHOTOREAL, that register's own top rejected pole, and was fixed on the first
  re-shot by passing `--register <pack>`. A reference shoot is the sparsest render there is (one
  subject, no scene), so it is where an anchor's subject is returned rather than merely leaking.
  `--register <id-or-path>` answers the refusal one way and `--no-style-pack` the other; both are
  free, and the refusal fires before any generation.

  **Scope, deliberately narrow.** This changes the SHOOT only. `compose-spread` and `cover` still
  read `identity.register.anchor` for canon renders, so no book renders differently. Making the pack
  the silent default for shoots would have made the reference matrix and the book disagree about the
  look with nothing said out loud; a refusal costs one flag and states the disagreement instead.
- **Portable (mirrors §3a self-containment).** A pack resolves every ref within its own folder, so it
  can be copied anywhere and still generate. A pack may live standalone OR inside a universe
  (`reference/style/<pack>/`); the skill only ever needs the pack path.
- **A ref can record WHO blessed it, and it is bound to the bytes (v0.41).** A pack is defined as
  built from "blessed reference images", and until v0.41 nothing on disk could say WHICH ones a
  person actually looked at: the scaffolder copies every ref identically, so a ref the operator
  approved by name and a candidate swept in beside it were byte-indistinguishable. **The blessing is
  a marker file, not a manifest field:** `<pack>/refs/<ref>.blessed.json`, holding `ref`, `sha256`,
  `blessedBy`, `blessedOn` and a `note`. It sits beside the ref exactly as `<ref>.recipe.json` does,
  which is what lets `create-style-pack` carry it into the pack on a rebuild and what keeps
  `pack.json` a description of the LOOK rather than a ledger of who said yes.

      bless_ref.py <pack> --ref <name> --by "<who, when>" [--note "<why>"] [--rebless]
      bless_ref.py <pack> --status

  **The `sha256` is the whole point.** A blessing approves specific BYTES, so a re-rolled ref makes
  the marker read `STALE` rather than silently transferring approval to an image nobody saw. A
  render has no seed, so "the same prompt again" is a different picture; the digest is the only
  thing that can tell the difference. This mirrors `--bless-seed`'s `sha256_16` and the engine's
  `goldenDigest`.

  **`--by` is REQUIRED and is deliberately not defaulted to `"human"`.** `chain_matrix.py
  --bless-seed` hardcodes that value (G12), so its markers cannot tell the operator from a delegated
  agent read-back and cannot be audited afterward. Say who, and when.

  **Four refusals, each one a way the record could become a lie:** a ref the pack does not LIST
  (a blessing on an unused file approves nothing); a listed ref not on disk; an existing blessing
  overwritten without `--rebless` (the previous approver is kept under `replaced`); and no `--by`.

  `--status` reports each ref as `blessed` / `STALE` / `unblessed` / `MISSING`, counts them, and
  **warns specifically when the ANCHOR is unblessed**, because the anchor is passed FIRST on every
  render the pack will ever make and is therefore the one ref whose approval propagates into
  everything downstream. `scaffold.py` prints the same coverage line at the end of a build.

  **Partial coverage is a normal and honest state; reporting it as full is not.** Earned on
  `pov-fine-screen-halftone` (proof-of-vibes, 2026-08-20): seven refs, of which the operator had
  individually approved two, a fact that existed only in a work folder's NOTES.md. When he then
  blessed a third by name there was no verb to record it with, and the framework's two existing
  blessing primitives (`--bless-seed`, `abu import-asset --blessed-by`) are entity-scoped and
  import-scoped respectively and neither takes a pack.
- **The gate is the load-bearing half.** A pack without a `gate` is a mood board. The gate is what
  turns "looks roughly right" into a checkable read-back (§3.5): generate, verify each assertion
  against the pixels, re-roll the specific failure. The finger-count defect is a gate concern, not a
  prompt concern — and an ink-line look whose hands are deliberately non-anatomical sidesteps it by
  construction.
- **`requiredEntities` (v0.45, optional).** A list of canon entity ids the pack's law depends
  on. When present, `generate.py` REFUSES a render in that pack unless every listed id is bound
  through `--entity <universe-path>:<id>[@look]`, and it refuses at pack load, before any
  provider is called or any file is written. `--waive-entity <id>` lifts one entry for a single
  render that genuinely carries no instance of it (a landscape with no mark in frame) and is
  recorded in the recipe as `waivedEntities`, the way `--permit` is recorded; waiving an id the
  pack does not require is itself a refusal. The field names the id only; which universe holds
  it is the caller's, because a pack is portable and a universe path is not.

  The defect that earned it, 2026-09-10: `afrochristofuturism`'s note said in prose that the
  North Star Cross must come from the locked canon entity, never from a prompt. Four album-cover
  candidates rendered without it, every one carrying a plausible four-point star with the wrong
  proportions, and the operator caught it by eye ("make sure to get exact nsc dimensions"). A
  note in `pack.json` is read by nobody at render time; a field the compiler checks is. The
  universe's own `make-piece.py` wrapper grew the same gate the same night, which is how a
  universe-local fix tells you the framework was missing one.

- **`textPolicy` (v0.12, REQUIRED on new packs).** One of three values. A blanket text ban was the
  wrong shape: it conflated three different things, and it silently degraded artifacts whose whole
  job is to explain something.

  | value | means | example |
  |---|---|---|
  | `none` | no glyphs at all | a mark or icon destined for a cutout |
  | `diegetic` | text that exists IN the depicted world is allowed and must be spelled correctly | a book cover in frame, a sign, a jar label, a spine |
  | `furniture` | `diegetic`, PLUS explanatory chrome the image itself carries | a hero strip's title bar, per-panel captions, footer bar |

  The prohibition that survives all three: **never render text the surrounding
  layout already supplies.** A spread must not burn in the caption the page lays
  out beside it, and a wiki page's H1 does not belong inside its own hero. That
  duplication was the real defect the old ban was reaching for. It is about
  duplication, not about glyphs.

  **Any text a pack permits is gated, never trusted.** The caller declares the exact
  strings; the read-back (§3.5) verifies each one character-exact against the pixels;
  a misspelling or a dropped glyph is a DEFECT and forces a re-roll from scratch. This
  is the same posture the framework already takes on a cover's title. Packs written
  before v0.12 with no `textPolicy` are read as `diegetic`, which matches what most of
  them meant.

### 4.7.1 Lookbook (the portable VARIED vocabulary)

A **Lookbook** is the complement of a Style Pack. A Style Pack defines ONE look and every render
matches it; a Lookbook defines a curated but intentionally **varied** family — a wardrobe/fashion, a
range of building silhouettes, a crowd of faces — and every render must draw from the range while
**differing** from any single exemplar. It exists because the alternatives are wrong for variety: a
`motif`/`prop` (SPEC §12) forces a thing to render *identically*, and a Style Pack is a render medium,
not subject content. Improvising a bare folder of "clothing refs" is the drift it kills.

```
<lookbook>/
  lookbook.json
  refs/*.png   # 4-12 deliberately VARIED exemplars; range is the point
```

```jsonc
{
  "id": "christofuturist-fashion",
  "kind": "lookbook",
  "name": "Christofuturist Fashion",
  "refs": ["refs/a.png", "..."],              // 4-12, pack-relative; NO single anchor (nothing to match)
  "aesthetic": "modest, dignified, individual, timeless-yet-modern Kingdom dress",
  "varietyRule": "dress each person differently, drawn from this range; never a uniform, never two people matching",
  "gate": [                                    // checked against the OUTPUT — VARIETY assertions
    "no two people are dressed alike",
    "not one palette across the whole crowd",
    "individual, dignified, modest dress (never a commune uniform)"
  ],
  "minRefs": 3
}
```

Optional fields, all added in v0.28 so a lookbook can say WHEN it applies and what it forbids:

```jsonc
{
  "always": true,                        // the universe BASELINE: governs every clothed figure
  "appliesWhen": ["children", "meal"],   // context tags that pull it in without anyone naming it
  "negatives": ["no kaftans", "..."]     // goes INTO the prompt; `gate` is checked on the OUTPUT
}
```

- **Consumed** by a renderer (`on-brand-image --lookbook`, repeatable): sample 2-4 refs (varying the
  SUBSET, not merely the order), prepend `aesthetic` + `varietyRule`, add `negatives` to the prompt,
  carry the `gate` into read-back, re-roll a uniform result from scratch. It rides ALONGSIDE a Style
  Pack (pack = medium, lookbook = varied subject). Lookbook refs are ordered AFTER entity refs and
  after the pack anchor: a lookbook is a range to draw FROM, never a thing to reproduce, so it must
  not outrank the subject's own locked plates.
- **Sampling must vary MEMBERSHIP.** A renderer that always hands the model `refs[:n]` has quietly
  turned the lookbook into a Style Pack with extra steps; the range on disk stops being range the
  moment the renderer stops rotating through it. Sampling is seeded (normally on the output path) so
  it varies across a batch while any single render replays identically from its recipe.
- **Bound to a universe** through a **craft-canon register-rule** (§13) whose `lookbook`/`alsoBinds`
  name it, so uniformity can never silently return. (First use: rule `godly-aligned-dress` → lookbook
  `christofuturist-fashion`, because a Christofuturist community that dresses in one beige linen reads as
  a commune, not a flourishing Kingdom.)
- **A craft binding does NOT make a lookbook fire.** It says "this vocabulary is canon here"; `always`,
  `appliesWhen` or an entity binding say "this render obeys it". Conflating the two means resolving two
  people standing together drags in the MEAL vocabulary and the ROOM-DRESSING vocabulary, which is
  exactly what the v0.28 implementation did on its first pass. Bound-but-untriggered lookbooks are
  reported as *available*, so nobody concludes the universe lacks one.
- **The gate is load-bearing, and it checks VARIETY.** A lookbook without a variety gate is a mood board
  that drifts back to a uniform on the first render. `validate` now REFUSES a lookbook with an empty
  `gate`, with refs declared but missing on disk, or with fewer live refs than its own `minRefs`.

**WHY v0.28 EXISTS.** From v0.12 to v0.27 every bullet above except the last two was FICTION.
`--lookbook` wrote the lookbook's name into the recipe, after the image already existed, and did
nothing else: it sampled nothing, prepended nothing and gated nothing, while the engine held zero
lines about lookbooks. Craft canon in two universes instructed renderers to "pass `--lookbook X` so
the renderer samples 2-4 exemplars, applies the varietyRule and gates the output" — three behaviours
described, none implemented, and the recipe asserted the vocabulary had been used. This is the same
defect class as v0.23 through v0.26: **canon that is correct and unexecutable.** The observable cost
was that a universe's clothing rules reached the model only when an agent happened to read the craft
canon and retype it by hand, so the look drifted between sessions for reasons nobody could see.

### 4.7.2 Wardrobe (v0.28) — binding clothes to a PERSON

`structured.wardrobe` on an entity answers "what does *this one* wear", which no primitive could
express before. A lookbook is a universe's vocabulary; a wardrobe is one character's claim on it.

```jsonc
"wardrobe": {
  "lookbooks": ["christofuturist-fashion", "christofuturist-mens-fashion"],
  "era": "the house line, favoring The Texas as his everyday fit",   // prose, steers the look
  "alwaysWears": ["the north-star-cross pendant at the sternum"],    // per-render non-negotiables
  "negatives": ["no beaded devotional strands", "..."],              // garment-level, additive
  "note": "why this binding exists"
}
```

Resolution merges, in order of increasing specificity: the universe **baseline** (`always`) →
**context** triggers (`appliesWhen` vs the render's tags) → each entity's **binding** → anything named
**explicitly**. Later layers only ADD. Nothing removes, because a wardrobe rule that a more specific
layer could silently switch off is the v0.24 lock-gate demotion bug wearing a different hat; an entity
that must not wear something says so in its own additive `negatives`.

`validate` refuses a `wardrobe` with an unknown key, a scalar where a list belongs, or a binding to a
lookbook that is not on disk — the same failure class as a `requiredForRender` naming a sheet with no
path: it reads as a constraint and is silently nothing.

**The point is automatic resolution.** `on-brand-image --entity <universe>:gary` now brings Gary's
bound lookbooks, era, always-worn props and garment negatives with it, without the caller knowing any
of those exist. `abu wardrobe <universe> <entity...> [--context tags]` answers the same question
outside a render. The defect that earned it, 2026-08-01: two fully-locked characters with nine blessed
plates between them had NO wardrobe binding of any kind, and the one prose instruction that gestured
at one pointed at a field that was `null`.

### 4.8 Form (RETIRED ENCODING, v0.17)

**Canon is the matter. A form is what shapes it. A work (§4.9) is canon given form.** That much
holds and is not in question.

**What is retired is the ENCODING, not the concept.** From v0.6 to v0.16 this section specified a
form as `surface` / `requires` / `slots` / `generators` / `invariants` / `emits`, executed by a
single universal composer (§4.10). That model was authored from one imagined example and never ran:
across the whole framework's life it produced **zero works**. No `work.json` was ever written, no
`work/` or `recipes/` directory ever existed, and the one form in the registry
(`scrolling-diorama`) was never worked. It shipped 91 unit tests and nothing made.

Meanwhile the pipeline that has produced more than a hundred illustrated books
(`make-a-book` → `render-book` → `compose-spread`) was never described by this section at all, and
was not even called a composer. The naming had the authority backwards: the proven thing was
unnamed and the unnamed thing was proven.

**The diagnosis, stated plainly so it is not repeated.** A slot schema caps a work at the
imagination of whoever authored the form, frozen at the worst possible moment. The failure was not
in the details of the encoding; it was in specifying a SHAPE where the standard should specify a
STANDARD.

**The replacement is deliberately not written here yet.** A second composer is being built for real
(`garysheng-art-series`, in the `gary-sheng-art` universe). When it is finished and judged good,
the shared surface between it and the book composer becomes this section. Writing the replacement
now, from one instance, is precisely the mistake that produced the retired model. Abstract from the
second instance, not the first.

Until then, a form is whatever a proven composer needs it to be, and no universe is asked to
conform to a schema this section cannot yet justify.

### 4.9 Work (RETIRED ENCODING, v0.17)

A **work** is one instance of a form, and that idea survives. Retired with §4.8 is its encoding: a
`work.json` binding ids to a form's required kinds and filling its declared slots.

Nothing was lost by deleting it, because nothing was ever expressed in it.

**One consequence worth stating.** The v0.6 changelog claimed the narrative fields (`logline`,
`spine`, `refrain`, `beats`) had moved out of `Story Spec` "into the storybook form's slot schema,
where they always belonged," with `Story Spec` retained only as a back-compat alias. That migration
was recorded as done and never happened: no storybook form was ever authored, so `Story Spec`
remained the live primitive that every book actually uses. It is not an alias and never became one.
Treat §4.3 as canonical for stories.

### 4.10 The Composer, the Compiler, and the Gate (v0.17)

The three-part split still holds and is the most durable thing this section ever said:

| Part | Nature | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Composer** | agentic, generative | *What should exist?* |
| **Compiler** | deterministic | *What exact prompt does this one slot become?* |
| **Gate** | verifying | *Is what came back actually right?* |

**What changed in v0.17 is the article.** This section said "THE Composer", singular, and a
universal executor was built to be it. The correction: **a composer is per-form.** Each kind of work
plans differently, and a storybook, a diptych series and a deck have genuinely different plans. What
they share is not the plan; it is everything underneath it.

**The compiler is shared and there is exactly one.** It is
`skills/compose-spread/scripts/assemble_prompt.py`, which carries every §4.6 normative guard
(uncast-character refusal, anchor-style guard, single-image guard, `registerAnchor` auto, altLooks,
dropSheets, auto-disambiguation, `guardedNegatives`). The retired composer forked it rather than
calling it, and the fork's 30-line `compile_slot` had none of those guards. That is the second time
this framework has grown two disjoint compilers, and the first time cost real books. There is one
compiler. Do not write a second.

**The gate is a role, not a service** (see `judge-slot`), and it fails closed: a slot whose judged
invariants could not be checked is UNJUDGED, never PASS.

**What belongs under a composer rather than inside one** is still being drawn, and is the open
question this section will answer once two composers exist to compare. The candidates, all of which
the retired executor implemented and none of which are form-specific: durable per-slot state,
resumability, recipes and drift-checking, provider adapters, and plan-time feasibility refusal
(which is not form machinery at all, but simply the first incremental eval).

### 4.11 Deterministic Generator (the asset that is CODE)

A **Deterministic Generator** is a program in the universe that DRAWS an asset instead of prompting
for one. It is the typed home for the rule the framework already asserts everywhere else and never
gave a place to live: *deterministic graphics render in code, not an image model.* Marks, favicon
sets, starfields, clouds, grids, scale rules, diagram furniture, colour-chip sheets — anything whose
correctness is a NUMBER rather than a judgement — belongs here.

Before this section, such code existed as loose scripts beside the assets they wrote, with ad-hoc
paths, hand-written provenance, hand-written install copying, and no discoverability. That is
framework-shaped work, so the framework owns it.

```
<universe>/generators/<id>/
  generator.json     # the manifest (below)
  generate.py        # the entrypoint; writes into out/
  out/               # generated artifacts + their .recipe.json sidecars
  proof/             # optional: contact sheets a human approved (see "the gate", below)
```

```jsonc
{
  "id": "north-star-cross-favicons",
  "name": "North Star Cross favicon set",
  "kind": "generator",
  "entrypoint": "generate.py",
  "determinism": "seeded",                  // "pure" (no randomness) | "seeded"
  "seed": 20260727,                          // REQUIRED when determinism is "seeded"
  "params": {                                // every knob, as DATA (see below)
    "markSpan": 0.71,
    "ground": "#0A0B10"
  },
  "inputs": ["reference/north-star-cross/mark-3d-gold-transparent.png"],
  "outputs": [
    { "path": "out/favicon.ico", "description": "multi-resolution .ico, 16 + 32 + 48" }
  ],
  "install": {                               // where an output lands in a consuming repo
    "out/favicon.ico": ["public/favicon.ico", "src/app/favicon.ico"]
  },
  "proof": {                                 // how a human checks it; see "the gate"
    "sheet": "proof/contact-sheet.png",
    "assertions": ["the mark reads at 16px on BOTH a light and a dark ground"]
  }
}
```

- **Every parameter is DATA, never a buried constant.** This is the load-bearing rule, and it is not
  tidiness. A generator's constants are its contract with the artifact, and two of them silently
  meaning different things is the characteristic bug of this primitive: a favicon generator carried
  `MARK_SPAN` as "fraction of the tile the mark fills" while the SVG it also emitted used the same
  number as an SVG `scale()`, which multiplies the whole coordinate system. The two disagreed by
  30%, and the descender was sheared off the bottom edge of every raster. Params in `generator.json`
  are what let a reviewer see the knobs without reading the code, and what force a derived value to
  be *derived* rather than retyped.
- **The gate is a PROOF, not a read-back.** §3.5 gives a render read-back because a model is
  stochastic and each output must be re-checked. A generator is reproducible, so re-checking every
  run is waste; what it needs instead is a **proof sheet a human approved once**, rendering the output
  at the sizes and on the grounds where it will actually be seen. Proof at real size, never at
  convenient size: the same favicon set looked correct at 512px and was clipping its descender at 16.
  A generator whose output is only ever viewed zoomed-in is untested.
- **Assumptions in a generator are testable, so test them.** Because it is cheap and repeatable, the
  cost of checking a design belief is one re-run. A ruling that "the 3D bevel turns to mush below
  48px, so small sizes use the flat vector" survived only until it was proofed side by side; the
  bevel read *better* small, because the lit/shadow split preserved the mark's long descender where
  the flat silhouette collapsed. State the assumption in a comment, then disprove it.
- **Provenance is the same contract, different fields.** A generated artifact still carries a
  `.recipe.json` sidecar (§3.2), but it records `generator` + `params` + `seed` + input hashes rather
  than `provider` + `prompt` + `refs`. The invariant is unchanged: no asset without its recipe.
  Freezing a recipe at lock (`lock-shot --recipe`) KEEPS `generator` / `deterministic` / `mode`
  (v0.54): dropping them made a locked massing blueprint read as painted.
- **`shape: "transform"` (v0.54) — a generator whose output path is the CALLER's.** A generator that
  finishes, converts or grades an asset someone else names (a film finish, a conform, an upscale)
  writes wherever `--out` says, so it has no fixed output to declare. It declares `shape:
  "transform"` and its `inputs` / `params`; `validate` checks the declared inputs resolve and waives
  the fixed-output rule. Any output it does declare (a proof plate) is still checked. The default
  shape is `"draw"`, which still requires outputs.
- **A folder under `generators/` with a program and no `generator.json` is a validate ERROR
  (v0.54).** It declares nothing, so every rule above was unenforced while `validate` stayed green.
- **`install` makes the universe the source of truth for derived assets.** A favicon set copied by
  hand into three sites is three sites that will drift, and they did: one shipped a mark from a
  rebrand fourteen months stale while another shipped an incomplete set. The manifest declares where
  each output belongs; installing is idempotent and reports only what changed.
- **Determinism is declared and enforced.** `pure` means byte-identical output for identical inputs.
  `seeded` means byte-identical *given the seed*, which must therefore be in the manifest and never
  in the code. Wall-clock, `random()` without a seed, and dict iteration order are defects.

Generators are the counterpart to Style Packs (§4.7): a pack governs what a MODEL should produce,
a generator replaces the model entirely where the answer is computable. When an asset can be
expressed either way, prefer the generator, because it is reproducible, reviewable, and free.


### 4.14 Endcap composition (the cover and the closing plate) — v0.36

The two portrait endcaps are compiled by `cover/compile_cover.py`, which resolves identity from
canon exactly as the interior compiler does. Two selectors govern what appears on them.

**`--no-cast`: a plate may be deliberately unpeopled.** The compiler auto-selects a hero from
`story.features` when `--hero` is absent, and previously REFUSED when the story cast no character.
That is right for a front cover and wrong for a closing plate, which is frequently an empty room
with the closing verse overlaid on it. There was no way to express "nobody is in this one", so the
hero was bound regardless and no amount of scene text overrode it: a reference image outranks
prose, which is a law stated elsewhere in this spec and applies to itself here.

`--no-cast` composes with no character, and additionally emits `any person, any human figure,
anyone standing in the room` as negatives, because the absence has to be argued rather than merely
omitted. It contradicts `--hero` and the two together REFUSE rather than resolving a precedence.

*Earned on Come Look (hyperagentic-age, 2026-08-06). Three paid re-rolls asked for an empty room
and each returned a full-length figure standing dead centre, occupying the lower half of the frame
that the closing verse is drawn into.*

**`--negative`: per-plate prohibitions, repeatable.** Register `rejectedPoles` and the standard
lettering negatives always apply and cannot be switched off from the command line; this flag ADDS
to them. Without it, a prohibition specific to one plate could only be written into the free-text
scene, which is the weakest available place to put one, since the scene is read as a description of
what to draw rather than as a constraint.

*Earned in the same run: a denominational cross and candle appeared on a cover, against the hero
entity's own locked rule that nothing denominational may appear, and could only be removed by
re-rolling with the prohibition restated inside the scene prose.*

**Neither flag weakens an existing guard.** Both are additive: `--no-cast` removes a binding the
operator never asked for, and `--negative` can only lengthen the negative list.

**Field selection is per KIND, matching the interior compiler (v0.39).** A character's prompt block
carries its invariants plus `render.always` / the selected pose's `bake`, exactly as before. A
motif or prop is prompted from `prose.rules` (or `structured.render.bake`), and its
`structured.invariants` reach the QA checklist ONLY, which is what `assemble_prompt.py` has always
done for those kinds. Before this, every non-setting entity fell down the character path and its
invariants were baked verbatim into the cover prompt; a motif's invariants are often MEDIUM-SCOPED
(true of its own standalone plates, false of a painterly cover that merely contains it), so the
leak contradicted the register in the prompt itself (winged-startup's plate-register lines on
takeoff-thursdays' cover, hyperagentic-age, 2026-08).

**`--no-text` reports honestly (v0.39).** The runner used to print "BAKED TEXT (read every glyph
back against these)" regardless of mode, over lines that were deliberately not baked, inviting a
false "missing title" defect on a closing plate whose contract is to carry no text. Under
`--no-text` it now states the actual check: art-only, ANY glyph in frame is a defect, and the
compiled `textLines` apply only to a later typeset pass if the platform runs one.

### 4.13 Shot (the DECLARED framing of a spread) — v0.35

A spread may declare `shot`, one value from a closed vocabulary, saying how the
picture is FRAMED. It is optional and absent by default, so every book written
before v0.35 assembles byte-identically; an unrecognised value REFUSES rather
than rendering as no framing at all.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: shots -->
| shot | what it frames |
| --- | --- |
| `wide` | The establishing view: the whole place, figures small inside it. |
| `two-shot` | Two figures together, waist up, the space soft behind them. |
| `group` | Three or more figures together, waist up, closer than an establishing view. |
| `close` | One face, chest up, filling the frame; the plate's camera distance is overridden. |
| `over-shoulder` | From behind one figure onto the other; the near shoulder frames the far face. |
| `insert` | Hands, an object, a surface. No faces, no whole figures. |
| `reverse` | The opposite camera on the same locked geometry, so handedness mirrors on purpose. |
| `thought-bubble` | The speaker small at one edge; a large soft-edged bubble holds what they are describing. |
| `imagined` | The frame IS what is being described; the speakers are not in it at all. |

RELIEF set (leave the conversation, draw the thing being talked about): `imagined`, `insert`, `thought-bubble`.
<!-- END GENERATED: shots -->

**The defect it exists for.** A cast plate's COMPOSITION wins over scene prose
(§4.6). A setting that declares one conversation camera therefore hands every
spread that selects it the same wide three-shot, no matter what the scene text
asks for. A book whose beats are a conversation then renders as one picture
repeated: nation-of-fire's *Bless You More* shipped fifteen consecutive spreads
sharing one setting, one plate and one cast, each scene politely requesting
"closer, chest up" and each losing to the plate. Nothing refused, because every
spread was individually valid.

**What declaring it changes.** Three things, and the third is the point:

1. The composer injects the shot's `framing` text **after the SCENE and before
   the entity blocks**, so a close-up's explicit "IGNORE THE CAMERA DISTANCE IN
   THE SUPPLIED REFERENCE PLATE" outranks the plate block that would otherwise
   carry the wide composition into the prompt.
2. Every framing is prefixed with a CONTINUITY clause: the camera moves and
   nothing else does. A shot never moves a person out of their seat, never
   empties a chair, never removes the furniture the subject is sitting at, and
   never deletes the other people in the room. **This was got wrong first.**
   Shots briefly carried a `dropsBlocking` flag that suppressed the setting's
   room-wide `contract.blocking` on close framings; because `blocking` carries
   SEATING AND HANDEDNESS, that swapped a husband and wife across their own
   table and rendered empty chairs beside them. The blocking law now holds at
   every camera distance, and only the narrow per-plate
   `contract.plates[...].includeBlocking` opt-out remains, where a human decides
   one plate has crowd content a close-up genuinely cannot contain.
3. A setting whose `contract.blockingPlate` is a drawn seating chart has that
   plate passed on every render, and the framing names it as the authority on
   who sits where. Prose cannot deliver a seating chart; a picture of lettered
   dummies with facing wedges can.
4. It makes variety MEASURABLE and therefore THINKABLE. `audit_spec_shots.py`
   reads the declared shot and refuses a monotonous spec before a single render
   is paid for (R1 sameness run, R2 dominant shape, R3 no relief, R4 vanishing
   cast); `compose_spec.py` suggests a shot rhythm on every new spread, so a
   scaffolded book is varied by construction rather than by inspiration.

**Cast is who is IN FRAME, not who the spread is about.** Cutting a spread's
cast down to its subject reads as tidy and is a deletion: the compiler's cast
closure states "THE ONLY CHARACTERS IN THIS IMAGE ARE ...", so a third person
at the same table is actively removed and his chair renders empty. R4 catches
it by looking for a person present on both sides of a spread but dropped from
its own cast, at an unchanged setting AND an unchanged plate.

**The relief shots.** `thought-bubble`, `imagined` and `insert` are grouped as
the RELIEF set because they leave the conversation and draw the thing being
talked ABOUT. A teaching book's argument lives in what is said, and without
relief every picture draws the saying instead of the said. The auditor requires
at least one relief shot per eight spreads in any book where a single setting
carries more than 60% of it.


### 4.15 Strip (a composite of panels, composed in code) — v0.53

A **strip** is two to four panels (three by default) assembled into one image. It is the shape a
work takes when it argues in beats: the ask in the real room, the work in agentspace, the result
coming back. The panels are generated; the strip is not, so its provenance is the provenance of
each panel plus the name of what assembled them.

**The spec.** A `strip.json` in the work folder names the universe, the composite's `out`, a
canvas (default 1536x1024, 16px margin and gutter, the gutter colour), a `maxRerolls` (default 4),
named `promptBlocks`, and 2 to 4 panels. Each panel carries a `beat` (what it argues), a `scene`
(what is in it), `entities` (rendered through `--entity`, so canon arrives as plates and
invariants), optional `refs` (resolved against the universe, refused if missing), the ordered
`blocks` of its prompt with `scene` where the scene sits, and optional `width`/`shift` for the
crop. The scene and the defect counters are the only free text in a panel prompt. A universe's
form writes the spec; `compose-strip` knows nothing about any universe.

**The loop, and why it is not one verb.** `render` makes one roll through the provider adapter
and runs `verify_render.py`; `judge` records the verdict of an agent who LOOKED. A PASS is refused
while the binding check reports anything, including a fired guard with no verdict. A DEFECT needs
a reason; the reject, its recipe, readback and prompt are MOVED to `panels/rejected/` with a
`.reject.json`, never deleted; its `counter` sentence is appended to every later roll of that
panel. `render` refuses a second roll while one is unjudged, and refuses past the first roll plus
`maxRerolls`. `reopen` un-keeps a kept panel with a reason and restarts its cap, because a
person's objection is a new judgement. A verb that rendered, judged and composed in one pass would
approve its own work.

**The composite recipe**, beside the composite, carries: `asset` (its path under the universe, or
the wiki path on an export), `mode: "composite"`, `compositor` and `generator`, `provider` and
`model` (every distinct value across the panels), `prompt` (every panel's EXACT prompt, labelled),
`refs` (every panel image and every ref every panel recipe lists), `panelRecipes` (each panel's
full recipe, by panel id), `panels` (beat, world, entities, path, hash, roll count, and every
reject with its reason), `compose` (canvas, widths, gutters, `borders: null`, `text: null`),
`stripSpec`, `canon`, `timestamp` and `sha256`. `compose` refuses to write a recipe that fails the
wiki preset's `validateRecipe` rules (ported rule for rule) OR the stricter completeness check,
which exists because the gate's composite branch returns after checking the parts: a composite
with no top-level prompt, refs or timestamp would pass it and leave a reader chasing panel files.
`--export` writes the wiki's copy (EXIF-transposed, 1600px long edge, WebP q82) with the recipe
restated for its `--export-asset` and a `derived` block naming the transform.

Earned 2026-09-25: four wiki-hero strips were each built from a long prose brief, each wrote a
one-off `compose.py`, and each recipe (`provider: "code"`, no prompt, no refs, no model) was
refused by the supersuit.wiki gate and fixed by hand in the wiki worktree.

**On the works board**, a strip's recipe names its `stripSpec`, so a RE-ROLL tap's detached job is
briefed to reopen the panel the note is about and recompose, never to re-roll the composite from a
recipe that records a composition rather than a model call.

## 5. Evolution & versioning

- **Every canon change is a commit** in the canon repo. The diff *is* the changelog.
- **Write-back is a proposal, then a commit.** A finished story proposes new/updated entities and
  relations; accepting them commits them into canon. This is how the universe grows from making
  stories.
- **Contradictions are explicit.** A `contradicts`/`supersedes` relation records when new canon
  overrides old, instead of silently editing history (testimony-over-prediction is honored: real
  events enter canon after they happen).
- **Time-travel is free.** Because canon is git, "what did the universe contain when story X shipped"
  is a checkout, not a feature.
- **Craft-canon is DISCOVERED, then encoded — not given (the deepest backtest finding).** The hardest
  book (*Kenosis*, immersive venue) ran on a large pile of rules the author learned *by failing*:
  hologram-vs-visitor translucency, projection inventories, "make her more obviously a hologram," the
  style-anchor-leaks-content trap. The framework does **not** produce those taste discoveries up
  front. What it does: (a) turn the *mechanical* failures (missing refs, drifting settings, unsourced
  beats) into hard errors so they stop recurring, and (b) give each *discovered* rule a first-class
  home (a craft-canon invariant, a new entity field) so it is paid for once and reused forever. Craft
  grows by making stories; the system's job is to capture it, not to pretend it precedes the work.

## 6. Nation of Fire as the reference implementation

Everything above already exists in Nation of Fire, informally. Agentic Brand Universe is the act of naming it.

| Agentic Brand Universe layer / primitive | Nation of Fire today | Gap to close |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canon (entities + relations) | `nof-universe/CANON.md` (prose) + typed `canon/entities` | promote to typed records; keep prose as fields |
| Refs (load-bearing) | `nof-universe/canon` (typed) + `assert.sh` → the engine | **built 2026-07-15**; generalized `nof-*` → universe-agnostic (the engine); **reference implementation made self-contained 2026-07-18** — all canon assets moved into `nof-universe/` (`assetRoot: "."`), so the universe resolves every reference inside its own repo and the folder was renamed `universe/` → `nof-universe/` |
| Setting contract | skill rule 17 (blueprint, empty-plates, $MAP, blocking/dressing) | encode as the setting entity's structured contract (resolver already refuses unlocked) |
| Story spec | each book's `MANUSCRIPT.md` + brand.json `books` entry | unify into one story-spec record |
| Renderer | `create-brand-os-picture-book` + `picture-book-platform` | wrap as the first named renderer |
| Quality: taste gates | words-before-art, register-point, face-lock, subject-approval | keep; make the gate list a first-class checklist |
| Quality: craft-canon | obedient-servant spine, refrain, awe-not-horror, gold-belongs-to-God | encode as spine/invariant records stories are checked against |
| Quality: provenance | the provenance check (victory-boyd lesson) | make `provenance` a required field per beat |

**First dogfood:** *Not Every Fire Is Holy* is mid-production on exactly this — its refs already
resolve through the load-bearing resolver, its setting (the arena) is correctly *refused* until
locked.

## 7. Non-goals (for v0.1)

- Not a general-purpose CMS or a fiction-writing chatbot.
- Not multi-renderer yet (picture-book only; the architecture *permits* more, we don't *build* more).
- Not a mass refactor of all existing books at once (incremental adoption; NoF stays runnable
  throughout).
- Not a replacement for human taste — the gates are load-bearing, deliberately.

## 8. Decisions (resolved 2026-07-15) + genuinely-open

**Decided (were open questions; the backtest gave enough evidence):**
- **Canon storage → one repo per universe.** Like `nation-of-fire/nof-universe` today. A shared
  multi-universe store is a premature abstraction; per-universe keeps git-as-evolution clean.
- **Structured-vs-prose → consumption decides.** Any field a renderer or resolver *consumes* is
  structured (load-bearing); everything else is prose. No field is both source-of-truth.
- **Craft-canon enforcement → graduated.** Hard-blocking for the mechanical and checkable (refrain
  present, spine declared, refs resolve, provenance non-empty, setting locked); advisory + judge-panel
  for the subjective (is the turn earned, is it moving). Never block on taste; never let a mechanical
  miss through.

**Still genuinely open:**
- **How much of the wiki is generated from canon** vs hand-authored. (Lean: concept pages
  hand-authored; worked-example pages derived from real canon records — but not committed until the
  wiki is scaffolded.)
- **Judge-panel design** for the subjective half of quality (rubric, how many lenses, when it runs).

## 9. Backtest / validation (2026-07-15)

The spec was audited against the real Nation of Fire roster (24 properties + a 24-entry crossover
log) — *would the books already made be creatable on this framework?*

- **~18 fit cleanly:** character-carried, antagonist-cast, ensemble, real-subject, setting-carried.
  **Crossovers are the strongest validation** — the 24-entry log is native as Relation records.
- **4 types strained v0.1 and are now folded in above:** non-journey **spines** (finding 1, *Honest
  Primer*), **`visual-metaphor`** as a kind (finding 2, *Hold It Up to Forever*), **register** as
  first-class (finding 3, *Painted in His Image*), the **`realPerson`** dossier (finding 4, the
  real-subject books).
- **Honest caveat:** the framework is reverse-engineered *from* these books, so post-hoc
  expressibility is half-circular. Its real value is preventing the *recurring mechanical* failures
  (ref-scatter, setting drift, the Charlotte leak, provenance contamination) and giving *discovered*
  taste a home — not auto-producing taste (see §5, craft-canon is discovered-then-encoded).
- **Verdict:** every existing book is expressible; the four additions close the strain; the next real
  test is whether the framework makes the *next* book cheaper, not the last fifteen describable.

## 11. Skills & Identity layer (v0.3)

The framework's operations — resolve an entity's refs, sweep canon before naming, register a new
entity, read back a render, gate voice, run a renderer — are **universe-agnostic**. They differ
between universes only in *data*, never in *procedure*. So:

> **A universe ships data; the framework ships skills.** Standing up universe #2 is filling in canon +
> an identity block, not forking a pipeline. A skill must NEVER hardcode a universe's name, path, mark,
> theme, cast, or voice terms — it takes a target universe and reads them.

**The identity block.** Every `universe.json` carries an `identity` object: the constants a universe is
known by, that generic skills read.

```jsonc
"identity": {
  "mark": "A NATION OF FIRE story",     // the "made in this universe" byline a renderer stamps
  "platformUniverseId": "nation-of-fire",// registry id when shipping to a shared platform
  "theme": "gold-belongs-to-god",        // brand token set / palette id
  "closingOrnament": "wisp",             // a recurring closing motif, if any
  "voice": { "capitalize": ["Kingdom","Spirit"], "oneWord": ["Christofuturist"],
             "preferTerms": [ /* see "Voice term rules" below (v0.58) */ ] }, // voice-gate rules
  "subjectApproval": { "realLivingPerson": "requires-blessing" }, // requires-blessing | none-required
  // `none-required` abolishes the per-subject blessing gate universe-wide. Entity validation then
  // stops demanding realPerson.approval.state, because there is no gate left to enforce (v0.6.1).
  "register": {                              // the universe's illustrative style (v0.4)
    "name": "detailed comic book",           // named style, defaulted by start-universe
    "anchor": "reference/register/style-anchor.png", // content-neutral swatch, passed FIRST every render
    "rejectedPoles": ["photoreal", "anime", "washed-out"],
    "anchorSubject": "an ancient oil lamp, a clay jar, robed figures" // optional: what the anchor DEPICTS
  }
}
```

**Register (v0.4).** A universe renders in one illustrative style. `identity.register` names it and
points at a content-neutral **style anchor** the renderer passes as the first reference on every
render, with `rejectedPoles` baked as negatives. A per-property `register` (SPEC §4.3) may still
override it. `start-new-story-universe` defaults `register.name` to "detailed comic book" and locks
the anchor via a style-lock step.

**`register.anchorSubject` (optional).** When the anchor is not perfectly content-neutral, this
field NAMES what it depicts, so a renderer can ban that subject concretely on every render. The
generic "take no subject from the style anchor" guard loses to a concrete picture: an oil-lamp
anchor put its own lamp and jar onto a spread that carried EIGHT other references, because the
scene had a table and the anchor had tabletop objects. Declared once per universe; kept in sync
with `anchor` (if the anchor image changes, this sentence changes with it). Consumers: Nation of
Fire's spread compiler negates it at render time (where the field was first earned), the
framework's `chain_matrix` negates it on every matrix shot (2026-08-02; before that, every matrix
shoot had to hand-negate it in prompts.md, and three did in one book run), and the framework's
cover compiler (`cover/compile_cover.py`, which `render_cover.py` delegates to) negates it on
every cover (2026-08-02; a cover passes the anchor FIRST like everything else, and the
readiness-lamp anchor painted an ancient burning oil lamp onto a cover wall — one paid re-roll on
eleventh-hour-heroes). When `--anchor-ref` overrides the anchor image, the cover compiler skips
the register's declared subject, because the sentence no longer describes what the first
reference depicts; a Style Pack override in `chain_matrix` likewise reads the PACK's own
`anchorSubject`. The framework's own spread composer (`compose-spread/assemble_prompt`) does NOT
yet read it and carries only the generic anchor guard; that gap is logged, not hidden. A Style
Pack may declare the same field for the same reason.

**Voice term rules (`identity.voice`).** The universe-local half of the voice gate
(`voice-gate`), each rule sized to how much judgment it needs:

| Field | Shape | Gate finding | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `oneWord` | terms | a split of the term (`Christo futurist`) | BLOCK |
| `capitalize` | terms | the term written all-lowercase | ADVISORY (the sense can invert: "his spirit") |
| `neverDisparage` | terms | the term beside a dismissive word | ADVISORY |
| `preferTerms` (v0.58) | entries, below | a bare form where the house term belongs; the house term in the wrong case | REVIEW / BLOCK |

`preferTerms` is for a universe that has a HOUSE TERM for something a bare word also names:
say "Agentic Edge", not "edge". Each entry:

```jsonc
{
  "prefer": "Agentic Edge",                 // the house term, in its one correct case
  "avoid": ["edge"],                        // bare/wrong forms it replaces: regex patterns,
                                            // case-insensitive, word-bounded by the gate;
                                            // a single string is accepted
  "except": ["\\bedge to edge\\b",          // ordinary senses that must NEVER fire:
             "\\bat the edges?\\b",         // patterns matched on the same line; an avoid
             "\\b(?:competitive|leading|cutting) edges?\\b"], // hit inside one is skipped
  "when": "it means the client's compounded context", // the sense, printed with the finding
  "severity": "review",                     // "review" (default) | "block"
  "decided": { "date": "2026-09-29", "who": "...", "verbatim": "..." } // optional provenance
}
```

What the gate does with it, on every line outside a blockquote (verbatim quotation keeps its
printed wording):

- The preferred term in the wrong case ("agentic edge") is `prefer-term-case`, **BLOCK**. No
  judgment exists, so no waiver applies. Any `capitalize` advisory on the same span is
  suppressed, so one mistake is one finding.
- A bare form not inside the preferred term and not inside an `except` match is
  `prefer-term`, **REVIEW** by default: fix it (the finding carries the line rewritten with
  the preferred term) or waive it with a written reason like any REVIEW. `severity: "block"`
  hardens it for a universe whose bare form has no ordinary sense at all.
- `except` is how the rule stays trustworthy. A bare word usually has an ordinary sense (a
  border, a margin, an advantage), and a rule that fires on "teal runs edge to edge" trains
  the author to force the gate. Name the ordinary senses once, in the universe, rather than
  waiving them one sentence at a time. An ordinary sense `except` does not cover yet is a
  pattern to add, not a waiver to write, once it recurs.

`lint-universe` refuses a malformed entry (`VOICE-PREFER-TERMS-SHAPE`: not a list, no
`prefer`, no `avoid`, an unknown `severity`) and a pattern that does not compile
(`VOICE-PREFER-TERM-BAD-PATTERN`) as errors, because the gate skips what it cannot read and a
skipped rule is silent. An entry with no `except` key warns (`VOICE-PREFER-TERM-NO-EXCEPT`);
`"except": []` says there are no ordinary senses and silences it.

Earned 2026-09-29 on continental-works. Gary: "Always capitalize Edge and ideally say Agentic
Edge always." `capitalize` could carry "Agentic Edge" but not a bare "Edge", because it
matches the word anywhere and would flag every border and margin, so the universe wrote the
rule as a `preferTerms` entry the gate did not read and marked it "not yet enforced".

**Surface roles (`identity.surfaces`, v0.59, optional).** A renderer OUTSIDE the universe (a
slide deck, a published page, a share card, a wiki theme) needs three colors: what it paints the
ground, the text and the one accent. Canon already holds them, but in no fixed place and under no
fixed names, and the names do not travel: in Christofuturism `brand.chrome.ink` is the bone TEXT
color on a night ground, in Continental Works `palette.json` `ink` is the warm GROUND. A consumer
that reads token names therefore paints one of the two universes inside out. So the universe
says it, per surface, and the consumer reads roles only:

```jsonc
"surfaces": {
  "default":  { "tokens": "canon/craft/palette.json#tokens",            // <file>#<dot.path to a map>
                "roles": { "ground": "ink", "text": "cream", "accent": "live" } },
  "artifact": { "tokens": "canon/craft/the-ascent.json#tokens",
                "roles": { "ground": "cream", "text": "ink", "accent": "teal" },
                "display": "Fraunces" }                                 // optional font family
}
```

- A token is a hex string or an object with `hex` (both shapes are in use; neither moves).
- A surface the declaration does not name falls back to `default`, which is therefore required.
- Keys beginning `_` are comments.
- **`validate` refuses** a missing file, a path that is not a map, a role that is missing or names
  a token the map lacks, a value that is not a hex, and a missing `default`, every defect at once.
  The declaration is read by tools that never run this engine, so the universe's own gate is the
  only place a stale one can be caught before it renders a deck in someone else's colors.
- The consumer of record is Freedom (`freedom-brand.mjs`, freedom#163), which resolves the
  surface for a deck or a published page from the universe the operator's workspace loads as its
  brand. The roles are canon; how a consumer maps them onto its own variables is the consumer's.

**Craft-canon is data, not skill prose.** Genres, spines, and register rules a universe discovers
(SPEC §3.5, §5) are typed canon records the renderer reads — NOT paragraphs buried in a skill file.
Craft rules living as skill-file scar tissue is the exact drift this framework exists to kill (§1); a
genre like "expectant biography" or a spine like "obedient-servant" is a record stories declare against,
so it is paid for once and reused by every future universe that adopts it.

**Two skill tiers.**
- **Framework skills** (in the `agenticstory` plugin, parameterized by `--universe <path>` or by
  discovering `universe.json` upward): ref resolution, casting sweep, entity registration, render
  read-back, voice gate, and each medium renderer. Written once; every universe inherits them.
- **Universe data** (in the universe repo): canon (entities/relations/stories), assets (self-contained,
  §3a), the `identity` block, and craft-canon records. No per-universe skill *code* — only data the
  framework skills consume.

The tell that a "universe-specific" skill is really a framework skill wearing a costume: renaming the
universe folder edits the skill. If a rename touches a skill, that skill was hardcoding a universe that
belonged in its `identity` block. (The Nation of Fire audit, 2026-07-18, found all nine of its skills
were generic procedure over universe-specific data — zero needed bespoke code.)

## 13. Craft-canon records (v0.4.1)

Craft-canon is data, not skill prose (SPEC §11). A universe's discovered craft lives as typed records
in `canon/craft/*.json`, loaded and validated by the engine:

- **spine** — a story's arc invariant (obedient-servant, thesis, primer, testimony, ...). A story's
  `spine` field names one. Craft-canon checks a story against ITS declared spine, never one assumed shape.
- **genre** — a book type with its own format canon (e.g. the expectant biography, the visualized
  epistle). A renderer reads the genre a property declares.
- **register-rule** — a universe-wide visual or narrative law (e.g. "gold belongs to God",
  "testimony over prediction", "awe not horror") the renderer honors on every unit.
- **kit** (v0.60) — the brand's catalog of PIECES and NO-GOS, read by a gate. See §13.1.
- **lines** (v0.61) — the brand's approved LANGUAGE, one golden line at a time. See §13.2.

Each record: `{ id, kind, name, summary, rules, origin }`. `rules` (or `summary`) is required; `origin`
records where a rule was discovered. The collection is OPTIONAL: a universe with no `canon/craft/`
validates unchanged. This is how a genre discovered making one book (SPEC §5, craft is discovered then
encoded) is paid for once and reused by every future property and universe.

### 13.1 The kit: pieces and no-gos (v0.60)

A brand is made of small reusable parts (a selection state, a button, a thread of stripes, a
section marker) and of things it refuses. Before v0.60 neither had a typed home: pieces lived as
sentences inside register-rule prose or only in a site's CSS, and refusals were scattered across
rule text, icon notes and project STATE files. Nothing could READ a refusal, so it held only as
long as somebody remembered it, and a refused shape could sit in canon itself as the instruction.

A kit is a craft-canon record with `"kind": "kit"` (a universe may have more than one; ids are
unique across all of them). Since v0.61 `validate` refuses two files in `canon/craft` that carry
the same record `id`, for a kit and every other craft kind: the store keeps one record per id,
so the later file used to replace the earlier one silently. The shape:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "brand-kit", "kind": "kit", "name": "...", "summary": "...",
  "tokensFrom": "canon/craft/the-ascent.json#tokens",   // optional: the map a recipe's tokens name
  "pieces": [{
    "id": "selection-ring",                 // kebab-case
    "name": "The selection ring",
    "for": "what it is for",
    "recipe": { "tokens": ["teal", "mustard", "tomato"], "css": "...", "sizes": "..." },
    "definedAt": "canon/craft/the-ascent.json#icon.rules.4",   // a piece ALREADY defined points, never copies
    "usedIn": ["where it is used, free text"],
    "decided": { "by": "Gary Sheng", "on": "2026-10-06", "verbatim": "his words" }
  }],
  "noGos": [{
    "id": "edge-stripe-on-selection",
    "refuses": "what is refused", "why": "why",
    "instead": "selection-ring",            // a piece id, or null plus "insteadNote"
    "decided": { "by": "...", "on": "YYYY-MM-DD", "verbatim": "..." },
    "source": [{ "at": "canon/craft/the-ascent.json#rules.4", "quote": "the line it was lifted from" }],
    "supersedes": [{ "at": "<file>#<path of the LIVE line>", "said": "the words it used to say" }],
    "scope": "optional: where the ruling was made, when it is narrower than the whole brand",
    "detect": [{ "pattern": "<regex over a source file>", "files": ["*.css"], "note": "..." }]
  }]
}
```

A pointer is `<file>#<dot.path>` inside the universe; a numeric segment indexes a list. A source
in a sibling repo is written `<repo>:<path>[@<commit>]` and is recorded, not checked.

**What `validate` refuses**, every defect at once: an item with no `decided` (by, a `YYYY-MM-DD`
date, and `verbatim`, unless the item cites a `source`); a piece with neither `recipe` nor
`definedAt`, or a `definedAt` that does not resolve; a recipe token missing from `tokensFrom`; a
no-go with no `refuses`/`why`/`instead`, an `instead` naming no piece, or a null `instead` with no
`insteadNote`; a `source` quote no longer present at its pointer (so a harvested no-go cannot
outlive the canon line it came from silently); a `supersedes` line that STILL says the old words
(a ruling recorded in the kit while canon still instructs the opposite is two sources of truth);
a duplicate id; a `detect` pattern that does not compile.

**Supersession is recorded, never deleted.** When a ruling replaces a canon line, the live line is
rewritten to point at the piece, the old words are kept in a supersession note beside it with the
date and the verbatim, and the no-go's `supersedes` names the line, which `validate` then holds
to its new text.

**The gate: `abu check-kit <universe> <path>...`** runs every no-go's `detect` patterns over the
source files under the paths (CSS, HTML, JS/TS and component files by default; `node_modules`,
`.git` and build output skipped) and prints each hit with the piece to use instead. Exit 1 on a
hit, 0 clean, 2 when no no-go declares a detector. Patterns run over the WHOLE file so a rule
split across lines is caught; write them with `[^}]*` rather than `.*` so one match cannot span
two CSS rules. A detector is a floor, not proof: a no-go about taste ("no italics") may have
none, and an inline React style is invisible to a CSS-shaped pattern. Run it over every surface
the universe governs before calling a rename of a piece done, and over a sibling repo to list
the places still on a superseded rule.

`abu kit <universe> [--json]` lists the pieces and no-gos. The scaffolding verb is the
`add-piece-or-no-go` skill.

Earned 2026-10-06 on continental-works. A selected card in a book reader carried the six-stripe
ribbon down its left edge only, exactly as canon (`surfaces.frapp.roles.chosenOption`) said to.
Gary: "I really don't like it when you ... use the stripes like the way you did it for Diane ...
make it like a full multi-border instead of just a left border ... And I want whatever you do with
that to be part of the ABU, as like, I think the ABU should be cataloging all these different Lego
pieces of the brand and no-goes."

### 13.2 The lines: a brand's approved language (v0.61)

A brand says a small number of things over and over: what it is, what it is for, who it is for,
why to believe it. Before v0.61 a universe could hold the TERMS those sentences use
(`identity.voice`) and nothing else about them. An approved sentence lived wherever it was last
typed, every other page saying the same thing was a copy with no link back, and a changed wording
reached none of them.

A lines record is a craft-canon record with `"kind": "lines"`. A universe normally has one. It
may have more than one only when the operator made the others by hand, since a verb creates the
first and never a second; line ids are unique across all of them:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "brand-lines", "kind": "lines", "name": "...", "summary": "...",
  "approvers": ["Ada Reyes", "Ben Okafor"],   // whose yes makes a line golden; any ONE is enough
  "lines": [{
    "id": "what-it-is",                        // kebab-case
    "name": "What it is",
    "for": "the answer when someone asks what the product is",
    "status": "golden",                        // candidate | golden | retired
    "text": "The suit you build out of software you own.",
    "version": 2,                              // goes up by one each time the text changes
    "audiences": ["public", "client"],         // any of: public, client, team, cofounder
    "decided": { "by": "Ada Reyes", "on": "2026-10-20", "verbatim": "say software you own" },
    "history": [{ "version": 1, "text": "The suit you build.",
                  "replacedOn": "2026-10-20", "replacedBy": "Ada Reyes" }],
    "instead": "another-line-id"               // retired only: the id of a golden or retired line, or null plus "insteadNote"
  }]
}
```

**Three statuses.** A `candidate` is a wording somebody proposed: a harvest, a draft, an agent's
suggestion. It carries no `decided`, fails no gate and reaches no surface. A `golden` line is one
an approver said yes to, and the yes is on the record. A `retired` line is one the brand stopped
saying; it stays in the record with what to say instead, because a page may still carry it.

**Golden means a person approved it.** `decided.by` must be one of the record's `approvers`, and
`decided.verbatim` is required with no substitute. This is the one place the kit's rule is made
stricter: a kit item harvested from canon may cite a `source` in place of a verbatim, but canon
that states a sentence is evidence that the sentence was used, never that someone approved it.

**What the record cannot prove.** The engine checks that `decided.by` is a listed approver and
that words are recorded. It cannot check that the person spoke them. The record is evidence,
reviewable in the diff, never proof. Three things are therefore rules for whoever runs the verbs
and are not enforced by code: `--verbatim` is the person's actual words, never composed for
them; `--approver` on the first line names people the operator named; the record file is not
edited by hand to add an approver. A verb never creates a second record and never changes
`approvers`.

**History is kept, always.** Every earlier wording stays in `history` with the date it was
replaced and by whom. The record needs it to say what a line used to be, and a check needs it to
FIND an out-of-date page: a surface carrying an earlier wording of a line is out of date, and it
is found by searching for that wording, with nothing declared in the surface.

**What `validate` refuses**, every defect at once.

- In a record: `approvers` that is not a list of at least one name; `lines` that is not a list;
  a line that is not an object.
- In a line's identity: an `id` that is not kebab-case, or one already used by another line in
  any lines record; a missing `name`, `for` or `text`; a `status` outside the three; `audiences`
  that is not a list of at least one, or that names anything but `public`, `client`, `team`,
  `cofounder`.
- In the yes: a golden or retired line with no `decided`, no `decided.by`, a `decided.by` who is
  not one of the record's approvers, a `decided.on` that is not a real calendar date written
  `YYYY-MM-DD` (`2026-02-30` is refused), or no `decided.verbatim`; a candidate that carries a
  `decided`.
- In the versions: a `version` that is not a whole number of 1 or more; a `history` that is not
  a list; a history entry that is not an object, or that lacks `text`, a real `YYYY-MM-DD`
  `replacedOn`, or `replacedBy`; a `history` that does not hold versions 1 to `version - 1`
  exactly once each; two consecutive versions with the same wording.
- In a retired line: no `instead`; a null `instead` with no `insteadNote`; an `instead` that is
  neither a string nor null; an `instead` that names itself, a line that does not exist, or a
  candidate. `instead` may name a golden line or another retired line, since the line it names
  may itself have been retired later, and then that line's own `instead` says where to go. A
  chain ends at a golden line or at a retired line whose `instead` is null. A chain that loops
  (`a -> b -> a`) is refused.
- Across lines: two lines that are not retired with the same wording, in one record or two.
- Across craft files, for every craft kind: one record `id` declared by two files in
  `canon/craft`, reported with both filenames.

**Same wording** means equal after removing what is not wording: line breaks and runs of space,
curly quotation marks, markdown emphasis marks, and the link around a linked word. Case is kept.

**The verbs.** `abu lines <universe> [--status S] [--json]` lists, and never raises on a
hand-edited record: it prints what is there and `validate` says what is wrong with it. `abu
line-add` records a candidate, or a golden line when it arrives with `--by` and `--verbatim`.
`abu line-bless` makes a candidate golden. `abu line-reword` gives a line new words: a candidate
is replaced and takes no yes (a `--by` there is refused, never dropped), a golden line moves its
old wording into `history`, goes up one version and takes the new yes. `abu line-retire` retires
a line with `--instead <id>` (a golden line, or a retired one) or `--note`, one or the other. A
yes is `--by` and `--verbatim` together, neither of them empty.

**Which record a verb changes.** The universe's one lines record, whatever its filename. When
there are several, `--record <file>` says which, and it must name one that already exists;
without it the verb is refused with their names. A verb creates a record only when the universe
has none, only at `canon/craft/brand-lines.json`, with the file's stem as its `id`, and that
first `line-add` needs `--approver` once per person. Once a record exists `--approver` is
refused, never ignored: who can approve is changed by the operator in the record file. A record
is always a `.json` file directly inside `canon/craft`, because that is the only place
`validate` reads; `--record` naming anything else is refused.

**What a write guarantees.** The new content goes to a temporary file beside the record and is
moved into place in one step, as UTF-8 whatever the locale, so a write that fails leaves the
record exactly as it was. Each write is then re-validated through a fresh store, which must
have loaded THIS file for the record's `id`. When it loaded another file's record, or two files
declare that `id`, or validation refuses or raises, the previous bytes are restored (or the new
file removed). No verb leaves a record `validate` would reject, and none reports a write nothing
validated. A record file that is not valid JSON, or not UTF-8, is refused, never raised. The
scaffolding skill is `add-or-update-line`.

**What is not here yet.** A register of the surfaces a universe governs, the scan that finds a
line on them, the generated map of which surface carries which line, and the check that fails
on an out-of-date one are the next release. This section is the record they read.

Earned 2026-10-13 on continental-works. Gary: "if you don't create the provenance chain between
surfaces and the goldens, there's the opportunity for drift is just so natural, even for a
two-person team that's evolving quickly."

"Locked" must mean something checkable per kind. The reference matrix is the canonical set of
reference shots an entity needs before it is fully renderable, so tooling can report
under-referenced entities the way the gate reports missing files.

**Cross-entity refs in a shoot, and the `@sheet` selector (v0.25).** A shot in
`reference/<id>/prompts.md` declares the OTHER canon entities it shows, so they are
conditioned on their locked art rather than redrawn from prose:

    **Refs (every shot):** <entity-id>, ...          (header, applies to every shot)
    REFS: <entity-id>, ...                           (in a shot body, that shot only)
    REFS: <entity-id>@<sheet>+<sheet>, ...           (v0.25: name the sheets)

A **bare id** passes that entity's `requiredForRender` set, which is unchanged and is the
common case. An **`@sheet+sheet` selector** names additional sheets, which are passed FIRST,
with `requiredForRender` still following. **A selector may raise the ref set and must never
lower it** — v0.24's lock rule one layer out, and for the same reason: the mechanism that
lets an author say MORE must not quietly become a mechanism for saying less. A selector
naming a sheet the entity does not declare, or declares with no art on disk, is a REFUSAL
rather than a shrug, because silently ignoring a mistyped selector sends the render off with
exactly the plate set the author was trying to add to.

**A REQUIRED sheet that is not on disk YET is DROPPED; a SELECTED one still refuses (v0.30).**
The two halves of the wanted set are held to different standards on purpose. A sheet the
author NAMED in the token must exist, for the reason just given. A sheet that arrived only
because it sits in `requiredForRender` is silently skipped when its art has not been made
yet, and the shoot proceeds on whatever remains; if nothing remains, that is a refusal.

This applies during a REFERENCE SHOOT only, where a not-yet-existing plate is the normal
state of the world rather than an error. `requiredForRender` is the gate on RENDERING a
spread, and `assert-story` and the compiler still enforce it in full there.

The defect that earned it (2026-08-03, nation-of-fire `he-is-a-jealous-god`): the
blueprint-seeded chain this spec and `make-a-book` both prescribe for a multi-state object.
`the-aimed-mirror` had a code-drawn `blueprint.png` on disk and four state plates yet to be
shot, so its seed shot said `REFS: the-aimed-mirror@blueprint`. That refused, because
`requiredForRender` named `master`, whose art the shoot was about to create. The only way
past it was to temporarily rewrite `requiredForRender` to a sheet that already existed,
shoot, and put it back after locking, which is an author falsifying an entity's own render
gate to satisfy a check about something else. A guard that can only be cleared by lying
about canon is a guard that teaches people to edit canon.

Tokens are merged by ENTITY, not by string, so a header `Refs` and a per-shot `REFS` naming
one entity resolve it once. Each ref is recorded in the shot's `.recipe.json` under
`crossEntityRefs` with its `sheet` name as well as its path and hash: once two shots can
reference one entity with different plates, "entity + path" no longer identifies what was
approved in a form a later divergence check can read.

The defect that earned it: an entity's extra sheets were unreachable from a shoot. A
multi-angle `turnaround`, a worn/in-situ plate, or a material variant could be registered and
provenanced and named by the entity's own `structured.render.always`, and no shot could ask
for it. On christofuturism's `north-star-cross` the fabrication spec explicitly prefers the
turnaround because a single flat front view flattens back into an equilateral star; three
flat plates were all the resolver could pass, and the rendered pendant measured 1.79:1
height-to-width against a spec of 1.24:1.

**HOW A MATRIX IS CHAINED, and the two ways the default is wrong (v0.31).** The shoot is
sequential and each shot conditions on the human-blessed seed plus the most recently accepted
shots. That is correct when the matrix is ANGLES on one unchanging subject, where every accepted
view makes the next more consistent. It is wrong in two specific shapes, and both were driven
around by hand before the tool could express them.

- **A CODE-DRAWN SHOT IS CONDITIONING, NEVER WORK.** A shot whose art is already on disk AND whose
  `<shot>.png.recipe.json` records a deterministic generator (an `agenticstory.*` generator such as
  `elevation` or `massing`, or any §4.11 generator declaring `deterministic` with no `model`) is
  NEVER planned for generation. It is skipped and passed as conditioning to EVERY shot in that
  entity's matrix, ahead of the painted goldens, which on the seed makes it the only conditioning
  there is — the blueprint-seeded chain v0.15 and `make-a-book` both prescribe for a multi-state
  object. Naming such a shot in `--shots` or `--seed` is a REFUSAL rather than a skip: an implicit
  skip is the ergonomic default, and an explicit request to overwrite deterministic art with an AI
  render is someone asking for a loss. **The RECIPE decides, never the filename**, because
  `blueprint` is a convention and a painted plate may legitimately carry that name; an asset with no
  recipe at all is treated as paint, since the pre-provenance library is real art.
  The defect (2026-08-03, nation-of-fire `the-shelter-he-held-up`): the plan seeded on `master` and
  listed `blueprint` as shot 2 conditioned on the style anchor, which would have overwritten an
  `abu elevation` output and destroyed the geometry seed every later state was built on. Reaching
  the prescribed shape instead took hand-adding `REFS: <id>@blueprint` to four prompts.md sections
  and hand-declaring `structured.sheets.blueprint` before the selector would resolve.
- **STAR TOPOLOGY: `--star` (alias `--no-sibling-chain`).** Every non-seed shot conditions on the
  blessed seed and on any code-drawn geometry, and on NO sibling. Use it whenever the shots are
  STATES rather than angles — states that differ in lighting, weather, season, or the presence or
  absence of something. Cumulative chaining walks each state's light into the next and no negative
  can undo it, because a reference image outranks any word. A sibling is not a candidate under
  `--star`, so no `--max-conditioning` value widens it back in.
  The defect: `the-shelter-he-held-up`'s states are a cold night plate, a warm-gold daylight plate
  carrying the book's register law, and a cool overcast morning, and the only way to shoot them was
  invoking the chain once per state as `--shots master,<one-state> --skip-existing`.
  `the-broken-cisterns`'s own `authority.note` records the identical finding in prose, one book
  earlier, with no flag to act on it.

Both are recorded in the shot's single recipe: code-drawn conditioning under `codeDrawnRefs`
(alongside `crossEntityRefs`, under the same rule that a provenance writer may not under-report
its inputs), and the topology in `method`.

- **character** — the anti-uncanny-valley set: `face-neutral`, `face-3q`, `expressions`,
  `forward-fullbody`, `profile-left`, `profile-right`, `back`, `signature-pose`. Minimum
  (`requiredForRender`) is `forward-fullbody` + `face-neutral`; the rest strengthen identity
  consistency across renders. Real people are generated from a photo stack (never a
  painting-of-a-painting); fictional characters from a locked design.
  - **`structured.requiredForRenderOnLock` (v0.11) — a per-entity override of the kind's minimum.**
    The matrix minimum above is a per-KIND default, and some entities need a STRICTER gate: a
    character whose three-quarter face carries a signature the front view cannot show should not
    become renderable without `face-3q`. Authors kept discovering this and independently inventing
    this exact field in their universes, where nothing read it, so the stricter intent silently did
    nothing. It is now first-class: when present it REPLACES the kind's required list everywhere the
    engine computes the gate (`lock-shot` promotion and `lock-level`). It may only ADD to the kind
    minimum, never drop below it, because a kind's minimum is what makes "locked" mean something.
    Omit it to accept the kind default, which is the common case.

    **THE GATE AND THE ALWAYS-PASS SET ARE TWO DIFFERENT LISTS, AND A MULTI-STATE ENTITY
    NEEDS THEM TO DIFFER (v0.34).** `requiredForRender` answers "what is passed to the
    model as a reference on EVERY render of this entity"; `requiredForRenderOnLock`
    answers "what must exist on disk before any render is allowed at all". For a
    single-state entity they can be the same list and usually are. For an object argued
    across STATES they must not be: `the-stronghold` (nation-of-fire, 2026-08-05) is one
    wall in four states, and putting `built` in `requiredForRender` would have passed the
    standing wall into the `fallen` spread and stood it back up, while leaving the gate
    empty would have let the book render against states that were never shot. The correct
    shape is an EMPTY `requiredForRender` (the per-spread `plate`/`pose` selector supplies
    the one state that belongs in that frame) and a FULL `requiredForRenderOnLock` naming
    every state, so the existence gate is total and the reference pollution is zero.
    Reach for this whenever passing one plate would contradict another.
  - **`structured.scale` (v0.10) — relative height is canon, not a per-spread guess.** `{ "height":
    "5 ft 8 in", "relativeTo": { "<entity-id>": "several inches shorter than" }, "scalePlate":
    "reference/<id>/scale-two-up.png" }`. Every entity in the matrix is described ALONE, so two
    characters sharing a frame have a dimension that no record states: the model makes them the
    same height, or reverses them, and the drift is invisible until somebody who knows them says
    "he is much shorter than that." This is the v0.9 setting lesson applied to people. The
    compiler emits a `RELATIVE SCALE` line ONLY when two or more in-frame characters declare a
    relation to each other, so a solo spread is byte-identical to before. An optional `scalePlate`
    is a two-up plate of the pair at true relative height. Advisory: a character with no `scale`
    still locks and still renders; `lint-universe` warns `CHARACTER-SCALE-ONE-SIDED` when one
    character declares a relation its counterpart does not mirror, because two half-records drift
    apart and then contradict each other.
  - **`scale-plate` (v0.22) — the plate that makes a declared height CHECKABLE.** The `scale`
    record above is RELATIVE. It fixes two people against each other and cannot fix either
    against the world, and its `height` is prose that nothing depicts. Between them they answer
    "is he taller than her" and never "how tall is he", so a solo `forward-fullbody` on a blank
    ground still carries no unit of comparison: the model picks a stature and every render
    inherits the guess. That is v0.9's own sentence about rooms, unpaid for people — *a plate
    cannot be judged on a dimension it does not depict.*

    A `scale-plate` is a **solo, head-to-toe plate against a measured reference**, listed in
    `structured.sheets` like any other shot. The framework fixes the GEOMETRY, because that is
    what makes the plate readable at all:

    <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: scale-plate-contract -->
- solo subject, no second figure in frame
- full head-to-toe, feet visible and flat on even ground, nothing cropped
- camera at mid-torso height, square to the subject, no low or high angle
- no perspective foreshortening; the figure reads at true proportion
- a MEASURED reference in frame whose real size is stated in the recipe
- the subject's declared `structured.scale.height` is legible against that reference

Default measured reference, when a universe declares no `identity.scaleReference`: a discreet graduated vertical batten marked at each foot, or an architectural element of stated height (a door, a standard step riser, a counter) with its real dimension recorded in the plate's recipe
<!-- END GENERATED: scale-plate-contract -->

    The universe supplies the TREATMENT, via `identity.scaleReference`. The default is
    deliberately architectural rather than clinical: a graduated batten or a door of stated
    height reads as part of a built world in nearly every register, where a medical stadiometer
    reads as a prop and a symbolic or painterly universe would refuse it outright. Gary's ask
    (2026-08-01) was for "a measuring stick or something TASTEFUL", and taste here is
    register-local, which is exactly why the framework declines to fix it.

    It is a SEPARATE file from `forward-fullbody` and never a replacement: renders still cast
    the fullbody, and the scale plate is what a human and a linter read the height from.
    `optional`, not in `shots`, for the same reason `face-neutral-color` is — promoting it would
    demote every already-locked character in every universe to `partial`. Advisory:
    `lint-universe` warns `CHARACTER-NO-SCALE-PLATE`, `CHARACTER-HEIGHT-UNDEPICTED` (a height is
    declared but nothing on disk depicts it, the precise v0.9 failure) and
    `CHARACTER-SCALE-PLATE-MISSING`.
  - **A slot may declare its ROLE (v0.23).** `"sheets": {"denim-front": {"path": "...", "role":
    "garment"}}`. Roles are `identity` (face and likeness), `geometry` (shape and proportion),
    `garment` (the CUT of clothing, never its medium), `medium` (the paint language itself) and
    `scale` (see `scale-plate`). The bare-path form is unchanged and still correct; a slot that
    declares no role behaves exactly as it always did, which is why this migrates nothing. What
    the role buys is a per-ref instruction in the prompt — `REFERENCE ROLES, obey exactly:` —
    so the model is told what each reference is for instead of weighing them all equally. Earned
    on two watercolour costume plates that were admissible as matrix slots on a hyperreal
    character because their sidecars said "garment design only" in prose no gate could read.
  - **`structured.registerNeutral` (v0.37) — a matrix shot in NO REGISTER AT ALL.** `{ "medium":
    "hyper-realistic documentary photography", "why": "one photoreal master; every register is a
    conversion of it" }`. Both fields are required and `validate` refuses a declaration missing
    either. It applies to ONE case and it is a narrow one: an entity whose reference matrix is an
    **identity master** that every register rendition is later DERIVED from, rather than a plate
    set belonging to any register. A real person's photoreal digital twin is the case this was
    built for. Everything else keeps shooting anchor-first, unchanged.

    **The defect.** `chain_matrix.resolve_register` refused unconditionally on a null
    `identity.register.anchor` ("the universe style is not locked; do not generate"), and the two
    escapes beside it (`--register`, `--no-style-pack`) both choose WHICH anchor to pass, so
    neither could say none. That is an ordering deadlock for every universe built around a real
    person: the register gates the master, and the master is precisely the artefact that owes the
    register nothing. The framework's own vocabulary had carried the concept since v0.21, where
    `face-neutral-color` is documented in `matrix.py` as "a full-colour, REGISTER-NEUTRAL face
    plate", and nothing honoured it. Proof of Vibes (2026-08-06, Russ Ballard's brand, subject
    consenting) stated the architecture out loud and then could not bootstrap it: its
    `reference/russ-ballard/prompts.md` already read "deliberately refuses the anchor-first rule
    ... a master shot inside a register can only ever serve that register", which is a rule that
    could only be obeyed by leaving the framework.

    **It is CANON, not a flag.** Neutrality is a property of the matrix, not of one invocation. A
    flag would let the next operator re-shoot the master in-register with nothing complaining,
    which is the same failure the declaration exists to prevent, one person later. No ad-hoc flag
    was added for this reason.

    **NEUTRAL MEANS NO ANCHOR IS PASSED, not "an anchor is not required".** This is the
    non-obvious half. Once the universe finally blesses a register, a re-shoot would otherwise
    silently bake that register into the one asset whose whole job is to be medium-free, and a
    reference image outranks a word every time (the physics `dropSheets` and `--star` were both
    earned by). So an anchor reaching this matrix is a REFUSAL, never a warning: by the time
    anyone looks at the plate, the register is in it and no prompt takes it back out. What the
    shoot guarantees:

    <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: register-neutral-contract -->
- the register anchor IMAGE is not passed as a reference on any shot of this matrix
- the register's style line is not prepended; the entity's declared `medium` leads instead
- the register's `rejectedPoles` are not baked as negatives, because a pole is the opposite of a medium this matrix is not being shot in (the entity's own `structured.negatives` and its prompts.md negatives still are)
- the anchor-subject guard is not emitted, because no anchor's subject is in play
- `--register` and `--no-style-pack` are REFUSED, because both of them name WHICH anchor to pass and neither can name none
- every shot's recipe records `registerNeutral` and a null `anchor`, so a later reader can tell a deliberate absence from a forgotten input
<!-- END GENERATED: register-neutral-contract -->

    **The refusal teaches the route.** The null-anchor refusal above now names this path with the
    JSON to paste, the way the sibling `stylePack` refusal names `--register` and
    `--no-style-pack`. A refusal that dead-ends an operator who is doing something legal is how a
    framework gets routed around.

    **THE REAL-PERSON DEFAULT (v0.38).** An entity that declares `realPerson` with a non-empty
    `photoStack` and whose `structured` contains NO `registerNeutral` key at all is shot
    register-neutral BY DEFAULT, in the medium `"hyper-realistic painted portrait with
    photographic fidelity to the supplied photographs of the subject"`. The reason is a porting
    asymmetry: hyper-realism ports down into any register at render time (the register anchor
    styles the spread while the neutral plates carry likeness), but a reference shot inside a
    stylization has thrown likeness away that no later prompt can recover. The shooter RECORDS
    the adopted default into the entity's canon before shooting (neutrality is a property of the
    matrix, not of one invocation, per the v0.37 rule above), so the next shoot behaves
    identically without re-deriving anything. The recorded opt-out is `structured.registerNeutral:
    false`, which the default never overrides: a key that is present, including an explicit
    `false`, is the author's decision. Entities with no `realPerson` block are untouched and keep
    shooting anchor-first. The defect that earned it: `david-kobrosky` (hyperagentic-age,
    2026-08-08) had a five-photo stack and was shot in-register warm-editorial ink-and-wash
    because the neutral path was opt-in knowledge; the operator's correction was the rule
    verbatim ("hyper realism ports to not real but not other way around", "Abu should default to
    entity creation with hyper realism").

    **`role` is the other end of the same contract, and they compose.** Register-neutral is how
    the plate is MADE; a slot's `role` is how it is CONSUMED, and four of the five role
    instructions already say "Ignore its ... medium". `compose-spread` emits one entity-level line
    for a declared register-neutral cast entry (`REGISTER-NEUTRAL MASTER: <id>'s reference plates
    are <medium> and are NOT a style reference ... render <id> fully in this image's declared
    style"), because "these plates belong to no register" is only true of the SET, and per-slot
    roles then say what each plate contributes. `validate` refuses `role: "medium"` on a
    register-neutral entity as a contradiction in terms, and `lint-universe` warns
    `REGISTER-NEUTRAL-UNTYPED-SLOT` on slots that declare no role at all. No second vocabulary was
    added.

    **`REGISTER-UNLOCKED` stays an ERROR and only its wording changed.** A null
    `identity.register.anchor` still means every RENDER refuses, because `compose-spread` and the
    cover compiler both require it, so a universe in this state genuinely cannot make a spread, a
    cover or a book. What was false was the totalizing word "generation". The finding now names
    the one thing that IS legal, listing the universe's declared register-neutral entities by id.
    Downgrading it so a bootstrapping universe could go green would have weakened a check that is
    telling the truth.

    **Not covered: PER-SLOT neutrality.** `face-neutral-color` is a single neutral plate inside an
    otherwise in-register matrix, and this declaration is whole-matrix only. That is deliberate:
    the chain conditions each shot on its accepted siblings, so a half-neutral matrix walks the
    anchor into the neutral plates through the golden chain regardless of what the flagging says.
    A genuinely neutral single plate wants its own matrix. Filed as issue #15.
  - **`structured.sheetAliases: {newKey: oldKey}` (2026-08-02) — a DECLARED sheet alias.** The
    add-keys-never-remove pattern (a camera slot renamed without breaking every story or spec that
    names the old key: retired-hearthRotunda precedent; the-park-bench and apostle-lee-study camera
    aliases) used to be encoded by writing BOTH keys into `sheets` pointing at one file, which is
    indistinguishable from a dead duplicate and tripped `SHEET-DUPLICATE-ALIAS` on every
    intentional rename. Declaring the alias makes the intent a record: the resolver treats the
    alias as a sheet-lookup fallback (one hop; a real `sheets` key always wins), `validate` refuses
    an alias to nothing, to itself, or one whose two keys have diverged to different files, and
    lint skips declared aliases while undeclared duplicates still warn. `requiredForRender` naming
    both halves of an alias is still an error, because the same image passed twice carries no
    information regardless of intent.
  - **`structured.negatives` (v0.23) — a negative that names ONE person.** Emitted only on
    spreads where that entity is in frame. Some rules are absolute about an individual and must
    be silent about everyone else: a universe may forbid glasses on one character while
    explicitly permitting them on others, and a flat pack `rejectedPoles` entry cannot express
    that without overruling the second decision.
  - **`structured.altLooks` (documented in v0.10; load-bearing in the compiler well before it).**
    A named look that REPLACES part of the entity's identity for the spreads that select it:
    `{ "anchorPhoto", "sheets", "supersedes": [], "invariants": [], "dropSheets": [],
    "keepSheets": [], "keepPhotos": false, "render": {} }`. `supersedes` removes base invariants
    the look contradicts and `invariants` adds its own, so the QA checklist, the prompt block, and
    the computed negatives all agree by construction. `dropSheets` removes base sheets the look
    contradicts, because **a reference image outranks a word**: a look whose invariant said "neck
    completely bare" still had the adult pendant sheet passed, and the necklace rendered. An alt
    look **auto-drops the base FACE sheets**, since the look's own `anchorPhoto` is the face.
  - **`structured.render.poses.<key>.supersedes` / `.invariants` / `.negatives` (v0.29) — when the
    thing that changes is a POSE, not a look.** A pose could add a `bake` sentence and extra
    `sheets` and could not retire anything, so a pose that INVERTS one signature invariant had no
    legal expression. An `altLook` is the wrong instrument whenever the FACE must not change, because
    a look auto-drops the base face sheets; the only remaining move was hand-wording the base
    invariant as "...except in pose X", which is a rule enforced by an author remembering to phrase
    it and a read-back checklist that contradicts itself. A pose now retires base invariants and
    base negatives by exact string exactly as a look does, and adds its own, so **the prompt block,
    the QA checklist and the computed negatives agree by construction** for a pose as well as for a
    look. A pose that declares none of the three compiles exactly as before. Earned on
    `theo-doorchaser` (*The Tithe Is a Test*, 2026-08-02), whose jacket is worn half-on with the left
    sleeve off the shoulder in one recurring pose and fully on everywhere else.
  - **Declared-future (prophetic) looks (v0.10): `keepSheets`, `keepPhotos`.** A universe that
    permits expectant work renders a person's declared future, and that look inverts every
    assumption above: **the face is CONTINUOUS, the body changes, and the future has no
    photograph.** With no `anchorPhoto` and the face sheets auto-dropped, only BODY sheets reach
    the model, and those are the exact silhouette the look supersedes, so the output is a stranger
    with the right build. `keepSheets` names base sheets to pass anyway (the continuous face);
    `keepPhotos` passes the real person's photo stack, which is otherwise default-look only.
    `dropSheets` stays authoritative where the two overlap, so an explicit contradiction always
    outranks a keep. A look supplying no face source at all is REFUSED by `compose-spread` at
    compile time (which costs nothing) and warned by `lint-universe` as `LOOK-NO-IDENTITY-ANCHOR`
    one step earlier still. Each era gets its own key (`era-2028`, `era-2030`) and its own
    invariants, so a read-back checks the future body against what was declared rather than
    against today's.
  - **A DOCUMENTED PAST uses the same two fields, and this is not obvious from their name.**
    `keepSheets` / `keepPhotos` were introduced for a declared FUTURE, but the mechanism is
    TEMPORAL-DIRECTION-AGNOSTIC: it serves **any era the photo stack does not cover**, forward or
    back. A historical subject has exactly the same shape as a prophetic one. There is no
    photograph of Kenneth E. Hagin bedfast at fifteen in 1933; the only photographs that exist are
    of him in his eighties, so the two eras with no ground truth are both in the PAST.
  - **Where the photographs land decides the SHOOTING ORDER, and the order is load-bearing.**
    The default assumption is that the default look is shot from the photo stack and every era
    chains off it. When the photographs cover a NON-default era, **shoot the era that has ground
    truth FIRST and chain the others off it**, so the whole chain converges on one face. On
    `kenneth-hagin` that runs fully inverted: `elder` is shot from the two public photographs, the
    default young look is chained off `elder`, and `bedfast` is chained off the young look. Shooting
    the three eras in parallel from prose returns three different men who merely share a
    description, which is the failure the golden chain exists to prevent. A look whose photographs
    ARE the ground truth declares its own `anchorPhoto` / `photoStack`, which outranks the base face
    sheets by design.
  - **Locking an alt-look's art:** `lock-shot <universe> <id> <shot> <path> --look <key>` writes
    into `structured.altLooks[key].sheets` instead of the default matrix. It deliberately never
    touches `requiredForRender`, which is the DEFAULT look's gate: an era plate must not be able
    to satisfy it, or a character with no present-day body sheet would read as gate-real off a
    future one. An unknown look key is REFUSED rather than created, because a typo would
    otherwise mint a look nothing selects and no read-back ever checks.
  - **`validFor`: WHICH ERA A VARIANT IS LEGAL IN (v0.18).** A variant is a body a thing wears for
    part of its life, and until v0.18 nothing gated which one a spread could select: every altLook
    was equally legal on every spread. On a book spanning three ages of one man, nothing stopped a
    1933 beat picking the `elder` look, and nothing stopped a 1990 beat silently falling through to
    the default young face. **Both failures are silent.** The render succeeds, it is internally
    consistent and beautiful, and it is simply of the wrong person, so it survives read-back (which
    checks invariants, and the wrong era's invariants all pass) and is caught only by a human who
    happens to look at the date.
    - A variant may declare `"validFor": { "from": <n>, "to": <n> }`, either bound optional, so an
      open-ended era ("from 1974 onward") is expressible. A spread declares `"when": <n>`. Both are
      plain NUMBERS and the framework only ever compares them, so a universe may count in years or
      in beat indices without the framework knowing which.
    - **The DEFAULT look carries its window at `structured.validFor`**, not only the alt looks. The
      dangerous case is not merely picking the wrong alt look; it is FORGETTING to name one, and a
      gate that cannot see the default cannot catch that.
    - `compose-spread` REFUSES pre-spend and **names the variant that is legal at that date**, which
      is where the saving is: a gate that only says no still sends the operator to read canon.
    - **Opt-in at both ends, so nothing migrates.** A spread with no `when`, or an entity whose
      variants declare no window, compiles exactly as before. The gate fires only when both facts
      are stated and they contradict each other.
    - `lint-universe` sees what the compiler cannot: the shape of the whole variant SET.
      `VALIDFOR-PARTIAL` warns when some variants declare a window and others do not, because an
      undeclared variant stays legal at every date and the gate then has a hole precisely where the
      author believed it was closed. `VALIDFOR-INVERTED` and `VALIDFOR-MALFORMED` are errors.
    - Earned 2026-07-31 on `the-power-of-obeying` (69 spreads, 1917 to 2003), where the look had to
      be named by hand on all 71 spreads because nothing could check it.
- **setting** — the existing `contract`: `turnaround`, `emptyPlates[]`, `blueprint` (files) plus
  `map`, `blocking`, `dressing` (descriptors), **and `scalePlate` + the `scale` descriptor (v0.9)**.
  - **WHAT `locked` MEANS FOR A SETTING, IN ONE PLACE (v0.29).** The gate fields are
    `turnaround` + `blueprint` (non-null and on disk), `emptyPlates` (non-empty, all on disk) and the
    `map` / `blocking` / `dressing` descriptors (non-empty). `scalePlate`, `scale` and
    `blockingPlate` are **advisory** and never block promotion or rendering, which this section has
    said since v0.9. Three surfaces used to answer this question and gave three answers: `lock-shot`
    and `abu list` demanded every field including the advisory ones, while `resolve_setting`, the
    gate that actually refuses a render, looked at none of them. So a setting whose empty plates must
    contain no people (a painted scale plate would drag figures into every state of it) could never
    be promoted by the tool at all and had to be hand-flipped to `locked` in its JSON, which is the
    hand-editing the engine exists to remove. All three now call one predicate,
    `model.setting_contract_gaps`, and `lint-universe` warns `SETTING-LOCKED-BUT-GATE-REFUSES` on
    older canon whose recorded status the gate contradicts (six such entities in nation-of-fire).
  - **`contract` DESCRIBES the art; `structured.sheets` is what the RESOLVER READS (v0.30).**
    An entity that fills the first and leaves the second empty looks completely finished:
    `status: locked`, files on disk, every one carrying provenance. It fails much later and
    somewhere else, as `compose-spec` printing `available: NONE` for a place the author has
    already written into a beat, at which point no plate is passed and the spread renders off
    the style anchor alone. `lint-universe` now warns `LOCKED-BUT-NO-SHEETS` on any LOCKED
    entity that declares contract plates and no `sheets`, and prints the deterministic repair as pasteable JSON rather than as a
    description of it. **Every sheet is keyed by its FILENAME, never by the contract slot it
    came from**: a multi-state visual-metaphor stores its neutral plate as
    `contract.turnaround`, so keying by slot would emit `"turnaround": ".../master.png"` and
    leave the entity with no `master` key, which is the one name the resolver's own hero
    fallback looks for. The suggested `requiredForRender` is ONE single-view plate, a `master`
    if there is one and otherwise the first empty plate, and never the turnaround, because a
    multi-panel study passed on every render makes the model reproduce its layout.
    Unlocked entities are never flagged: `add-setting` scaffolds exactly that shape and it is
    correct until `shoot-references` fills the plates. Earned 2026-08-03 (nation-of-fire
    `he-is-a-jealous-god`) on `the-great-stage`, locked since 2026-07-19 with four plates and
    never once cast through the framework compiler, with ten sibling entities in the same state.
  - **`contract.emptyPlatesExpected` (v0.29, optional int) — the declared COUNT.** Without it the
    gate can only ask whether the list is non-empty, so a setting that genuinely needs four cameras
    is promoted to `locked` on the second and the two nobody shot are improvised at render time,
    differently every spread. Omit it to keep the old behaviour.
  - **A SETTING'S CONTRACT RIDES ON EVERY BOOK THAT REUSES IT, so it must hold nothing that
    belongs to ONE story (v0.29).** `contract.dressing` is injected into every prompt that casts the
    place and `contract.blockingPlate` is passed as a REFERENCE IMAGE on every one of those renders,
    whichever camera plate was selected, because placement is continuity rather than composition.
    Both are correct for the setting and catastrophic for a prop. `the-park-bench` was authored for
    *Will There Be Ice Cream*: its `dressing` read "Each of them holds an ice cream cone" and its
    blocking plate showed two mannequins holding cones. Three of the first seven spreads of an
    unrelated book came back with both men holding ice cream, through scene text AND a per-spread
    negative that banned ice cream BY NAME on every one of them. **A reference image plus an injected
    contract sentence together outrank a negative word**, which is the same law §12 already states as
    "a reference image outranks a word", one level up.
    - The durable fix is to move the prop into the spread's `scene` and reshoot the plate propless.
      `lint-universe` warns `SETTING-DRESSING-NAMES-HELD-PROP` when a setting's `dressing` or
      `blocking` says a person is holding, carrying or wearing a named object.
    - The escape hatch for the spread in front of you: `"blockingPlate": false` on the cast entry
      drops the plate for that spread, and `contract.plates.<plate>.includeBlockingPlate: false`
      drops it for every spread that selects that camera. Absent either, behaviour is unchanged.
  - **`scalePlate` (file) and `scale` (descriptor) exist because AN EMPTY PLATE CANNOT PROVE SIZE.**
    `emptyPlates` are people-free on purpose, so that a setting reference never bakes a character's
    face into the room. That rule is right and it stays. But it has a cost nobody priced: a
    figure-free interior has no unit of comparison, so a room reads as whatever size the model
    guesses, every render inherits the guess, and the drift is invisible until somebody who knows
    the place says "that room is supposed to be much bigger than that." A plate cannot be judged on
    a dimension it does not depict.
  - **A `scalePlate` is the same room with ANONYMOUS SCALE FIGURES**: a few people, small in frame,
    at a distance, turned away or in profile, faces not readable, plain clothing, never a canon
    character and never the subject. That satisfies the identity rule (no face is baked) while
    making size checkable. It is a SEPARATE file from `emptyPlates`, never a replacement: renders
    still cast an empty plate, and the scale plate is what a human and a linter read the room's size
    from.
  - **The `scale` descriptor states the size in HUMAN TERMS** ("a circular hall about 80 feet across,
    dome 45 feet at the crown, the fire opening about 12 feet wide"), because prose survives a
    re-render and a plate does not. It is passed in every prompt like `dressing`.
  - Advisory in v0.9, like the rest of the matrix: a setting with no `scalePlate` still locks and
    still renders. `lint-universe` warns (`SETTING-NO-SCALE-PLATE`) so the gap is visible before it
    is expensive. Earned 2026-07-25 on `christofuturist-home`, whose hearth room rendered small and
    cramped through a whole book because nothing in its contract said how big it was.
  - **TWO ERAS OF ONE PLACE STAY ONE ENTITY, and its ERA AXIS IS ITS PLATES (v0.18).** A setting
    deliberately does NOT get an `eras[]` array parallel to a character's `altLooks`. When a place
    must appear in two periods, the reason it is in the story at all is usually that **it is the
    same ground**, and splitting it into two entities destroys the only claim it exists to make.
    So both eras live in one `contract`: one `map` for the geometry that never changes, one
    `blueprint` (the code-built massing render of §12/v0.15) that BOTH eras are seeded on, and one
    `emptyPlates` list holding each era's plates. `blocking` and `dressing` name what each era adds
    and removes.
  - **A plate declares its own era window** under the existing per-plate config map,
    `contract.plates.<plate>.validFor` (see `validFor` above), so a dated spread cannot select the
    wrong period's plate. `contract.plates` already existed to scope what a close-up is told, so
    the era window needed no new schema shape.
  - **Compose both eras so one image can be laid over the other.** Name the MATCH POINT (a ridge, a
    roofline, a doorway) in `blocking` and require it visible in every plate of every era, or the
    two eras become two places that merely share an entity id. Earned 2026-07-31 on
    `the-broken-arrow-ground`, one Oklahoma parcel as a 1900s farm and as the 1976 site bought for
    RHEMA, whose whole argument is that the ground is the same.
- **visual-metaphor** — a locked master plus `state` plates (the object across its argued states).
  - **`contract.anchorShot` and `contract.blueprintWaived` (v0.54).** `anchorShot` names the shot
    that IS a visual-metaphor's anchor plate (`contract.turnaround`); it defaults to `master` and
    the scaffolder writes it, so an object whose base state has a designed name (`sealed`) locks
    into the contract instead of falling through to `emptyPlates`. `blueprintWaived: "<reason>"`
    waives the blueprint gate for a VISUAL-METAPHOR with no massable geometry (an organic aerial
    city); on a setting it is reported and not honoured, because a setting is architecture.
  - **`contract.states` and `add-entity --state` (v0.31) — the states are DECLARABLE.** A
    visual-metaphor shares the `contract` SHAPE with a setting and shares nothing else: it has no
    fixed cameras, no seating, and no rooms nested inside it, so it carries neither `partOf` nor
    `structured.houseRules`. `abu add-entity <u> visual-metaphor <id> --state <name>` (repeatable)
    emits `contract.states` (the ordered plate list: `blueprint`, `master`, then each argued
    state), `contract.emptyPlatesExpected` (so a three-state object cannot promote itself to
    `locked` after one plate), the matching null-valued `structured.sheets` keys, and one
    `structured.render.poses` entry per state passing that state's own plate — without which a
    spread naming the state is a hard refusal in the compiler, and the state is one no spread can
    select. `prompts.md` gets ONE section per state, the code-drawn-blueprint instruction, and its
    prose at heading level 3, because `chain_matrix` reads level-2 headings AS SHOTS and a `##`
    prose section is planned and shot as garbage. `--state` on any other kind is a refusal: a
    character's variants are `altLooks` and a setting's are `emptyPlates`.
    Earned 2026-08-03 on nation-of-fire `the-shelter-he-held-up`, where the scaffolder emitted a
    SETTING (room slots `empty-c1` and `scale`, a `houseRules` block, and no `structured.sheets`
    at all, which is the one key the compiler resolves plates from) and every state, sheet key,
    pose selector and invariant was hand-authored in a throwaway script.
  - **`master` IS this kind's `turnaround` (v0.31).** The contract shape is shared with `setting`,
    so the anchor plate is stored in `contract.turnaround` and the states in
    `contract.emptyPlates`. `lock-shot` accepts the SPEC's word: `abu lock-shot <u> <vm> master
    <path>` sets `contract.turnaround` and `structured.sheets.master`, and never files the anchor
    among the states. Before v0.31 it had no entry for `master` at all, so a complete four-plate
    shoot filed the anchor into `emptyPlates`, left `turnaround` null, and could never clear
    `setting_contract_gaps`; the entity sat at `status: unlocked` with no error anywhere and the
    only repair was hand-editing the JSON. Earned 2026-08-03 on nation-of-fire
    `the-shelter-he-held-up`. The alias is scoped to this kind: a `setting` has no `master` in its
    matrix, and promoting one would invent a slot the spec does not give that kind.
- **prop / motif** — `hero` plus `detail` crops.
  - **`prop.structured.scale` and an optional `prop` `scale-plate` (v0.22).** A prop had no size
    record of ANY kind, neither descriptor nor plate, which is the character defect one level
    down: an object that renders at the wrong size beside a figure is as wrong as a room that
    renders too small, and a pendant, a chair and a door were each whatever size the model
    assumed. This is the other half of Gary's 2026-08-01 ask — how tall different people **and
    different things** are. State the size in human terms (`"about 40 mm across, worn at the
    collarbone"`) and shoot a `scale-plate` when the object's size is load-bearing. Advisory:
    `lint-universe` warns `PROP-NO-SCALE`. A motif is a graphic signature rather than a physical
    object, so it takes neither.
  - **A motif or prop that code already draws points at it (v0.57, §4.1.1).** `add-motif` and
    `add-prop` ask for an existing implementation FIRST: when a component, generator or locked
    render already draws the element, `structured.implementation` names it and its captured
    original is the reference, and the `hero` / `detail` shots are optional rather than the
    element's definition.
  - **THE KEY IS `structured.scale.absolute`, and the checker used to name a different one
    (v0.49).** `assemble_prompt.py` emits the TRUE SIZE line from `structured.scale.absolute`,
    for an in-frame entity of ANY kind, and that is what a prop's size has to be written under
    to reach a prompt at all. `PROP-NO-SCALE` asked for `size` or `height`, so the two halves of
    one rule named different keys: a prop written the documented way still tripped the warning,
    and a prop written to satisfy the warning contributed nothing to any prompt. Both readings
    of "state the prop's size" produced a prop whose size never reached the model. The lint now
    accepts `absolute`, and warns `PROP-SCALE-NOT-EMITTED` on a size recorded under any other
    key, which is the worse of the two states because it looks compliant.
  - **`add-prop` now ASKS (v0.49).** The machinery and the grading both predate this; only the
    authoring prompt was missing, so nothing ever put the question in front of an author. The
    interview asks how big the object is in human terms, and a step fills
    `structured.scale.absolute` before the prompts are written, matching how `add-setting`
    forces `contract.scale` and `add-character` forces `structured.scale`. The incident: the
    supercharged laptop on `what-a-book-is-made-of` appears in most of twenty-one spreads and
    ranged from a notebook to a small television, because the entity declared its form, its
    colour and its rules and never once declared its size. That is the prop version of the
    hearth room that earned the setting rule in v0.9.

**A VISUAL-METAPHOR IS GRADED ON SIZE, SO IT IS NOW ASKED AND LINTED FOR IT (v0.49).** Three
surfaces disagreed about one kind. `universe-doctor` has scored `setting` and `visual-metaphor`
together on the `setting_size` dimension since v0.9; `scaffold_entity` gives a visual-metaphor the
setting's `contract` shape including `scalePlate` and `scale`; and neither `lint-universe` (which
asked for `kind == "setting"`) nor `add-visual-metaphor` (whose contract field list omitted both
keys and whose interview never mentioned size) knew. So a visual-metaphor lost points for a gap
nothing warned about and no author was ever asked to close. `lint-universe` now emits
`SETTING-NO-SCALE-PLATE` and `SETTING-NO-SCALE-DESCRIPTOR` for this kind too, under the same codes
because the grader treats them as one dimension, and the room-shaped checks (nesting, house rules,
the locked-gate agreement) stay setting-only, since a visual-metaphor has no rooms inside it.

**`lock_level(entity) -> stub | partial | locked`** (engine) reports completeness against the kind's
matrix. It is **advisory** in v0.4 and back-compatible: an entity that predates the matrix, or uses
its own sheet-key names, reports `partial` when its own `requiredForRender` resolves — it is not
broken, just not matrix-complete. The load-bearing gate (`assert_story` / `assert_spread`) is
unchanged: a missing REQUIRED sheet is still a hard error. A renderer MAY require `locked`.

This section is normative about the *shape* of the workload, not about a vendor. It exists because
"use a hosted agent runtime" is the kind of claim that sounds like a preference, and it is not one:
the composer's requirements fall out of §4.8 and §4.10 mechanically.

**What composing one non-trivial projection actually is.** Not a request. A storybook composition is
tens of slots; each slot is a compiler pass, one or more generator calls across different modalities,
then one or more gate evaluations, some of which are themselves model calls in fresh context. Slots
that fail re-roll. The whole thing runs for tens of minutes to hours, and the operator is not watching.

Five requirements, each traceable to a section above:

1. **Long-running and unattended.** From the failure model (§4.10): the composition continues past a
   defective slot and reports at the end. There is no human in the loop mid-run to answer a question,
   so the runtime must not depend on one.
2. **Durable state per slot.** Parking slot 19 and finishing slots 20 through 24 is only possible if
   per-slot state survives. A restart in the middle of an hour-long composition must not lose the
   nineteen slots that already passed their gate.
3. **Isolation.** A composer runs generated content, fetches references, and writes artifacts. Where
   one runtime serves several brands, one brand's canon and outputs must never reach another's.
4. **Secrets it holds but never sees.** Generators are third-party providers and publishing targets.
   The composer needs credentials at call time and must not embed them, which is what a vault is for.
5. **Skills, not a mega-prompt.** §4.10 requires the compiler to be deterministic and the craft to
   live in canon. In practice that means the agent carries the craft as *attached skills* it reads,
   with the doctrine that **the skill wins over the prompt** on conflict. A prompt that paraphrases a
   skill loses detail, and every defect traced back to the paraphrase (earned on the reference
   implementation's first unattended run).

**The honest scope of the claim.** Most work on a model platform is a single call, and most people
integrating an LLM into an app correctly need nothing from this section: one request, one response, no
state, no isolation problem. That is the overwhelmingly common case and it is well served by any SDK.

The claim here is narrower and therefore checkable: **once a deliverable requires many interdependent
generations, held to cross-slot invariants, over a run long enough that nobody watches it, the
workload has changed kind.** At that point the choice is to operate that infrastructure yourself, or
to rent it. Both are legitimate. The standard takes no position on which, and only insists that the
requirements above be met by whatever runs the composer.

**Reference implementation.** `yourparables-book-builder`: an agent created against the Messages API
with an agent toolset, a vault holding scoped credentials with a limited-networking allowlist, and
five attached craft skills (`canon-resolve`, `casting-sweep`, `compose-spread`, `cover`,
`render-readback`). Its doctrine states that it runs unattended, that it finishes or reports failure
clearly, that it never asks a human a question mid-run, and that the skill wins where the prompt and a
skill disagree. It composes and publishes illustrated, narrated books while the operator's machine is
closed.

## 15. The board of next moves (v0.47)

**A verb that finishes without saying what is now possible hands the operator a guessing game.**
Earned 2026-09-12, from Gary, after a twelve-hour session building a brand universe: *"ABU should
leverage askuserquestion a lot more / I keep wondering what the next possible actions are / This
should feel more like a game idk."*

**The framework already knew the answer and had no shape or moment in which to say it.**
`universe-doctor/scripts/grade.py --json` emits every open issue as
`{impact, dimension, what, fix}`, where `fix` IS the verb that closes it, and
`engine/agenticstory/workspace.py:plan` already ranks them. All of that surfaced only through
`abu/scripts/status.py` as three lines of prose, in a verb nobody invokes mid-build.

### What it emits

    python3 skills/abu/scripts/next_actions.py <universe> [--after <verb>] [--json] [--max 4]

A BOARD: at most four options, each carrying the verb, a plain-words statement of what you get
out of it, and what it is worth in points, with the first marked `(Recommended)`. Plus the
universe's grade, score and distance from 100.

**It does not ask.** The `AskUserQuestion` call belongs to the agent, because a script cannot
know what else is in flight in a conversation. The labels and descriptions are written to be
used verbatim.

### When it applies

- **`--after <verb>` whenever a verb has just finished.** It DROPS the move just made, which
  would otherwise top the board of the job you have this second completed, and PROMOTES what
  that move makes possible via the `FOLLOWS` table. The board then reads as a consequence rather
  than as a menu that ignored what you did. A verb absent from `FOLLOWS` degrades to a plain
  ranked board, which is the correct default.
- **A declared follow-on with no open issue is still offered**, and near the top. A verb usually
  has no open issue because nobody has reached it yet, which is exactly when offering it helps.
- **`explore` prints the board itself** at the end of every fan-out. Any verb that completes a
  unit of work should do the same. It is best-effort and can never fail a run: the rolls are the
  deliverable, they cost money and are not reproducible.

### Three refusals, each one a mistake already made in this stack

- **NO `preview` on the question.** A preview flips `AskUserQuestion` into a side-by-side layout
  that does not draw the visible `Other` row, and on a board of next moves the real answer is
  very often the fifth one, in the operator's head.
- **Four options maximum**, because that is the tool's limit. A fifth is a board the operator is
  told about and cannot use. The count omitted is reported instead.
- **`fix` is a HINT, not always a verb.** The grader legitimately returns prose such as
  `abu backfill-provenance (records what is knowable)` and
  `start-new-story-universe / edit universe.json`. Only a bare verb-shaped token is given the
  `/abu:` prefix; anything else passes through as the instruction it is, in `instruction` rather
  than `verb`. Prefixing everything produced `/abu:abu backfill-provenance (...)`, which is not
  a command anybody can run.

### The front door's one hard rule, as code (v0.49)

**`abu`'s whole premise is that a person never sees a shell command**: "a command in the
transcript is a defect in this skill". That was prose, and prose does not bind, so the
framework's own strings broke it in the two places most likely to be read aloud. The grader's
`fix` field is written for whoever maintains the GRADER (`write canon/properties/<id>.json,
then \`abu build-canon\``; `split the rooms into settings with \`partOf\``; `abu
backfill-provenance (...)`), and it reached the operator by two paths:

- **`workspace.humanize()` used `fix` as its FALLBACK** for any dimension with no sentence in
  `OUTCOMES`, and `setting_nesting` had no sentence there, so its backticked JSON keys went
  into `plan.headline.human` -- the one field `abu`'s own method tells the agent to say out
  loud. The previous test suite named the hole and blessed it, in a test called
  `test_unknown_dimension_falls_back`.
- **the board showed a non-verb-shaped `fix` as the LABEL** of a tappable option, by the
  pass-through rule directly above, which is right for a plain-English hint and wrong for the
  half of the real fix strings that are invocations.

So: `workspace.command_in(text)` returns the first command-shaped span in any string about to
reach a person, and nothing command-shaped survives `humanize()` whichever argument it arrived
in. A command-shaped label on the board is replaced by the dimension's outcome sentence rather
than blanked, because an option with no label is worse than one with a technical one. And
**every dimension the grader can emit must have a plain-language sentence in `OUTCOMES`**,
enforced by a test that reads `grade.py`'s own `RUBRIC`, so a new dimension cannot ship without
one. Same shape as the guard/`READBACK_GATE` pairing in §3.5.

The detector is deliberately conservative and a PATH is not a command. What it catches is an
invocation, a flag, a script by name and a shell operator. Over-triggering would silently blank
real sentences, which is a worse failure than the leak it closes.

### The other half of that rule, read retrospectively (v0.50)

The code above closes every path where the FRAMEWORK hands a string to a person. It cannot
close the other half: **the agent speaking on its own account**, in its own prose, in a message
that passes through no framework function on its way to the operator. No gate inside the run can
see that string, and building one would mean policing every sentence an agent writes, which is
a surface this framework does not want and could not enforce.

So it is caught AFTERWARDS, where the evidence already sits. `pave-the-path`'s `review_run.py`
already scores a run's transcript after the fact; it now also reads every assistant TEXT block
through the same `workspace.command_in()` and reports `commandsShownToOperator` with the span
and the sentence around it, plus a `commandVerdict` that says what to do rather than only
counting. Retrospective on purpose: it adds no new surface, interrupts nothing, and lands in
the sweep that already asks what a finished run should have done differently.

**Tool inputs are excluded, and that distinction is the whole point.** A command the agent RUNS
is the job. A command the agent TYPES AT THE OPERATOR is the rule broken. Thinking blocks are
excluded for the same reason: nobody reads them.

**The detector is imported, never re-implemented.** Two opinions about what counts as a command
is how one of them goes stale, and the front door would then be judged by the wrong rule. That
also means the conservatism carries over intact: a PATH is not a command, while an invocation, a
flag, a script by name and a shell operator all are.

### Why this is not decoration

What makes it feel like a game is three things the grader already supplies: a score that moved, a
ranked set of moves each worth a stated amount, and the fact that they are choices rather than a
wall. Nothing here is a flourish, and no new judgement was invented; the rubric stays in the
doctor.


## 10. Glossary

- **Universe / Canon** — the evolving graph of everything true in a story world.
- **Entity** — a typed node in canon (character, setting, doctrine, motif, beat, prop, group).
- **Load-bearing reference** — a reference whose absence is a build error, not a silent drift.
- **Story spec (§4.3)** — a medium-neutral spec selecting canon + beats + spine + provenance. The
  live primitive every book actually uses; it never became an alias for anything else (§4.9).
- **Renderer** — a pluggable projection of canon + story into one medium.
- **Craft-canon** — narrative-craft rules encoded as enforceable invariants (discovered, then encoded).
- **Write-back** — the new canon a finished story contributes to the universe.
- **Gate** — a point where human taste or a hard check must pass before proceeding.
- **Spine** — a story's declared arc invariant (obedient-servant, thesis, primer, testimony, …); not
  a single assumed shape.
- **Visual-metaphor** — an entity kind: the central object a whole book zooms into and argues through
  (the locked scale, the bazaar of cages); the book's spine-object.
- **Form (§4.8)** — what makes a work the KIND of thing it is (storybook, flyer, meme, share card,
  explanatory plate). Called *Projection* before v0.14. How a form is encoded is an OPEN question:
  the v0.6–v0.16 typed contract (surface, required kinds, slots, generators, invariants) is retired
  and §4.8 records that retirement rather than specifying a live contract.
- **Work (§4.9)** — ONE made thing: canon given form, carrying authorship present in neither. Called
  *Composition* before v0.14. Its v0.6–v0.16 encoding is retired with §4.8's. It never superseded
  `Story Spec`, which is still the live primitive for stories (§4.3).
- **Composer (§4.10)** — the agentic layer that plans a work and sequences its generation, answering
  to the gate. **Per form**, not one universal executor. The only layer where open-ended model
  intelligence belongs.
- **Gate, `computed` vs `judged` (§4.10)** — an invariant checkable by pure code versus one requiring
  a model to look. A `judged` invariant is evaluated in fresh context by an agent that never sees the
  plan, because the maker defends its own intent.
- **Cross-slot invariant** — an invariant only checkable across several generated units at once (a
  character being the same person on spread 3 and spread 19). The expensive class, and the thing
  locked goldens exist to serve. A deliverable's complexity is its cross-slot invariant count.
- **Register** — a story's paint-language: a first-class per-story renderer config, sometimes anchored
  to a real artist's own work, locked via experiments and passed as a content-neutral style anchor.
- **Style Pack (§4.7)** — a register's look extracted into a portable, universe-free folder (refs +
  anchor + palette + rejected poles + read-back gate). What "generate more images in this style"
  consumes when there is no recurring identity to pin, so no canon is needed. A register may point at
  one; the `on-brand-image` skill runs off one directly.
- **realPerson dossier** — the sub-block on a real-subject character: photo stack, approval state,
  sensitive list, activity-wardrobe eras, exact group count.
- **Self-containment (§3a)** — a universe owns its assets inside its own repo; you can clone the
  universe folder alone and every reference resolves. A universe that cannot move as one folder is not
  yet a universe.
- **Identity block** — the `universe.json` object holding a universe's constants (mark, platform id,
  theme, closing ornament, voice terms, subject-approval policy) that generic framework skills read
  instead of hardcoding the universe.
- **Framework skill vs universe data** — operations (ref resolution, casting sweep, entity register,
  render read-back, voice gate, renderers) are written once in the framework and parameterized by a
  target universe; a universe ships only data (canon, assets, identity, craft-canon), never skill code.
- **Reference matrix (§12)** — the canonical set of reference shots an entity needs per kind
  (a character's ~8 angles, a setting's contract, a visual-metaphor's states, a prop's hero+crops).
- **lock_level** — an advisory engine report of an entity's reference completeness: stub, partial,
  or locked against its kind's matrix. Distinct from the load-bearing gate, which hard-fails on
  missing required sheets.
- **Register** — a universe's illustrative style, a first-class `identity.register` (named style +
  a content-neutral style anchor passed first on every render); may be overridden per property.
- **Craft-canon record (§13)** — a typed `canon/craft/*.json` record (kind spine | genre |
  register-rule) holding a genre, spine, or universe-wide craft law a renderer honors; craft as data,
  not skill prose.
