Generate or edit images using OpenAI's image models. Default: gpt-image-2.5-sunburst.

The PROVIDER ID stays `gpt-image-2` even though the model no longer does. The id is the
adapter's name and it is recorded in every universe's generator pins and in the provenance
of every asset ever rendered through it; renaming it would invalidate all of that to fix a
label. What must be honest is the MODEL, and the recipe records `--model` verbatim, so an
asset made after 2026-09-09 says gpt-image-2.5-sunburst and one made before says
gpt-image-2. Read the recipe, never the folder, when you want to know what drew something.

Sunburst rather than flare because this adapter's job is chained editing off locked
reference sheets, and sunburst is the sibling OpenAI builds for edit precision and subject
preservation. Flare is the volume model; pass `--model gpt-image-2.5-flare` for a batch
where speed beats holding a face.

The openai FLOOR above is load-bearing, not tidiness. An unpinned `openai` let uv keep
reusing a months-old cached environment (openai 2.32.0), and that SDK version HANGS on a
multi-image `images.edit` call: the request goes out, the socket stays ESTABLISHED, and the
process sits at 0% CPU until the timeout fires, then burns a retry and does it again. The
same call on 2.48.0 returns in ~58s.

That failure is nasty because it looks like a slow API rather than a broken client, and the
instinct it provokes (raise --timeout) makes it strictly worse. If renders ever start
hanging with no error again, check the resolved SDK version FIRST:
    uv run --refresh <this script> ...
and if --refresh fixes it, raise the floor here rather than living on --refresh.

    Writing it here means no caller can forget it.

    ALWAYS REWRITES. The recipe must describe the bytes currently on disk, so when
    an asset is regenerated its sidecar is regenerated with it. The old
    skip-if-exists guard meant a re-roll overwrote the image and left provenance
    pointing at the DISCARDED one, which is worse than no recipe: it reads as
    audited while describing art nobody ever saw. That silently broke the single
    hottest path in the pipeline, since render-readback's whole contract is
    "on any DEFECT, regenerate that shot FROM SCRATCH" (found 2026-07-26 on the
    given-ark master, whose recipe still described a stone-looking first pass).
    Freezing provenance at APPROVAL is a locking step's job and not this
