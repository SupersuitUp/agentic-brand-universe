# Agentic Brand Universe — agent notes

This file exists for ONE reason: **27 scripts ship in this repo and they are filed by which
skill owns them, not by what job they do.** A script under `render-readback/scripts/` is
invisible to anyone who has not already decided to run render-readback, which is how a
session on 2026-08-01 hand-rolled the same contact-sheet montage roughly fifteen times with
`contact_sheet.py` sitting in the repo the whole time.

**Before you write a script, check this table.** It is indexed by JOB, in the words you
would use at the moment you need it.

## I need to...

| ...do this | Use |
|---|---|
| **make a contact sheet** of several renders | `render-readback/scripts/contact_sheet.py --out X.png --cols 3 *.png` |
| **see a set at the size and on the ground it will be used** (an avatar at 64 px on paper, an icon, a thumbnail) | `render-readback/scripts/contact_sheet.py --out X.png --at-size 64,240 --background '#FBF5E7' *.png` (or `explore --at-size 64,240 --background ...`, which writes `AT-SIZE-SHEET.png`). Never hand-roll a compare script. |
| **verify a render** — did the canon arrive, did the look bind, is the frame dead | `render-readback/scripts/verify_render.py <png> --expect "id@look"` |
| **crop in on a detail** to check an invariant (jaw, throat, a mark) | `render-readback/scripts/crop_zoom.py` — **use it BEFORE calling a defect.** A contact sheet is downsampled; a lace hem called "vertical stripes" from a 3-up was a correct horizontal band when zoomed. |
| **measure a figure** in a plate | `render-readback/scripts/measure.py figure` (`star` mode was withdrawn for false precision) |
| **measure how COARSE a screen is** (halftone dot pitch, weave, grid) | `render-readback/scripts/measure.py periodic <png> --patch x0,y0,x1,y1` — fractions, required, recorded. Reports `dotsAcrossWidth`. Reach for it any time a register's argument is a NUMBER; "coarse" is a word and a screen regresses silently under it. |
| **measure a COLOUR** against a target (sky, paper, ink) | `render-readback/scripts/measure.py patch <png> --patch x0,y0,x1,y1 --target '#RRGGBB'` — reports the mean hex and `dHex`, the MAX per-channel distance. |
| **measure HOW FAR A THING RUNS** (a fringe, a streak, a band), how continuous it is, how many there are | `render-readback/scripts/measure.py extent <png> --feature warm-chroma [--bridge 12]` — reports `longestRunFracW` and `occupancy`. **Any gate phrased as "short", "one place only", "does not reach the edge", "no longer than a sixth of the width" is an extent claim**, and it is an opinion until you run this. Use `--bridge` when a dotty feature the eye reads as ONE line arrives as several stretches. Refuses rather than guessing when the predicate cannot separate the feature from the ground. |
| **generate ANY image** | `on-brand-image/scripts/generate.py` — the single provider adapter. Never call a provider directly; this is what writes provenance. The provider finds its own key (env, then `~/.agents/.env/credentials.env`); never export it by hand. |
| **knock out a background** | `on-brand-image/scripts/chroma_key.py` (add `--choke 12` for a dark-on-dark silhouette, or despill leaves a yellow edge hairline) |
| **prove a framework change actually REACHED sessions** (committed AND pushed AND installed) | `evolve-abu/scripts/check_delivery.py --expect <path/you/added>` — exit **1 = yours** (unpushed), **2 = Gary's** (`/plugin update`), 0 = delivered. Run it at the END of every evolve-abu. A version bump that never reaches the remote is indistinguishable from no work at all. |
| **see where a universe stands** | `abu/scripts/status.py --json` |
| **grade a universe** | `universe-doctor/scripts/grade.py` |
| **grade a rendered book** | `book-doctor/scripts/book_doctor.py` |
| **static-check before rendering** (free, no API calls) | `lint-universe/scripts/lint.py` |
| **list what a universe can MAKE** | `make-a-work/scripts/forms.py list <universe>` (add `--json` for the machine path; emits `[]` for a universe with no forms yet, so a consumer never parses prose to learn "none") |
| **scaffold a style pack / lookbook** | `create-style-pack/scripts/scaffold.py`, `create-lookbook/scripts/scaffold.py` |
| **turn an explore pick into a style pack** (and record who picked) | `create-style-pack/scripts/scaffold.py --from-explore <out-dir> --pick <id> --decided-by "<who>" --verbatim "<words>" [--scope-use <book>:<role>]`. Never copy the drafts and bless them by hand. |
| **limit a look to some uses** / **allow a different medium than the register for one use** | a typed `scope` on the pack (`--scope-use`), and `identity.register.exceptions` in universe.json (SPEC v0.62). Render with `generate.py --use <id>`; a prose scope fails `validate`. |
| **scaffold a new form** (a new KIND of work) | `create-form/scripts/scaffold.py` (refuses on zero evidence works; the method lives in the create-form SKILL) |
| **assemble a spread prompt from canon** | `compose-spread/scripts/assemble_prompt.py` |
| **check a WHOLE render-spec's refs before rendering** (free, no model) | `compose-spread/scripts/audit_spec_refs.py <universe> <spec>` — **run it after compose-spec and after any spec edit.** Catches the silent one: spread-level `plate` selects the SETTING's plate, so on a spread with no `setting` it is ignored and the entity's plates never reach the model. Shipped once (Looked Like Hate, five candle spreads with zero spine-object plates) and recurred on God Does Not Need Our Help (26 spreads, zero arch plates). "Dry-run and look at the ref count" was already the instruction; looking is the part that fails. |
| **scaffold or re-sync a book render-spec** | `compose-spec/scripts/compose_spec.py` |
| **translate a render-spec out of the retired NoF dialect** (bake-as-selector -> `plate`/`pose`) | `compose-spread/scripts/migrate_render_spec.py translate <universe> <spec> [--write]` — the tool the BAKE-USED-AS-A-SELECTOR refusal names. Dry-run by default. Never hand-translate; takeoff-thursdays did once as declared debt and that is why this exists. |
| **re-roll an existing render AS IT WAS** (same model/prompt/refs, optional one-line delta, zero canon reads) | `reroll-slot/scripts/reroll_from_recipe.py <asset.png> [--note "delta"]` — reads the `.recipe.json` beside the asset, regenerates through the provider adapter, replays the recorded conform/publish for endcaps. ONE command, ONE image call. Wrong verb if the edit changes text/cast/look/setting (canon moved; use update-book). Earned 2026-08-07: an 85-call run spent 71 calls re-reading canon that sat in the slot's own recipe. |
| **score a run transcript** (tool histogram, first generation call, orientation verdict, and every shell command the run SHOWED the operator) | `pave-the-path/scripts/review_run.py runs/<id> [--json]` |
| **add / insert / renumber a spread** | `update-book/scripts/insert_spread.py` |
| **recast one entity as another across a story** | `update-book/scripts/recast_story.py` |
| **chain an entity's matrix shots** | `shoot-references/scripts/chain_matrix.py` — if the universe declares `identity.register.stylePack` AND an inline `anchor`, it REFUSES until you say which (`--register <pack>` / `--no-style-pack`). A shoot is sparse enough that the anchor's own subject comes back whole; nation-of-fire's seed came back photoreal off the inline anchor on 2026-08-04. |
| **shoot a PHOTOREAL IDENTITY MASTER before the register exists** | Same script, but declare `structured.registerNeutral: {"medium", "why"}` on the entity FIRST (SPEC 12, v0.37). The matrix then passes NO anchor at all, and `--register` / `--no-style-pack` are refused. This is the answer to "the universe style is not locked; do not generate" when the thing you are shooting is the master every register is later derived FROM. It is canon, never a flag: a flag cannot refuse the in-register re-shoot six months from now. |
| **show the operator every shot and record that they saw it** | `shoot-references/scripts/shot_board.py board --universe <u> --entity <id> --json <pngs>`. It opens a FRAPP that serves each picture and records both the serve and the tap, and prints a phone link — **text that link** through `freedom:message-myself`. A tap is what seen means (v0.50) and the art has to be in front of them for it to mean anything (v0.51), so `lock-shot` REFUSES a shot with no approving verdict AND one approved on a board that never served the picture. With no Freedom install it falls back to AskUserQuestion cards, you record each answer with `... tap <png> --verdict keep`, and every approval is written down as `unshown`. Never rewrite the questions it hands back: the off-list answer is already in the question text, because a preview costs the visible `Other` row. |
| **get a BATCH OF WORKS approved** (heroes, covers, cards, any run of finished images) | `approve-works/scripts/works_board.py open <manifest> --id <slug> --title "<T>"` — one batch per page on the phone, approve or re-roll each with a typed or spoken note, mounted at a stable store URL. **Text the phone link.** Verdicts go in the same seen sidecars as the shot board. **A re-roll tap re-rolls by itself**: it starts one detached `claude -p` job per work (brief, log and report in `~/.freedom/frapps/abu-works-board/jobs/`), which re-rolls from the recipe with the note, re-stamps, commits, pushes and texts; a second tap while it runs is refused. `ABU_WORKS_AUTOREROLL=0` keeps it manual, and then `works_board.py rerolls <id>` prints the `reroll_from_recipe.py --note` command for each. Never hand-build a review page for a batch again. Verify with `curl -I` (HEAD records no serve); after your own screenshot, `open ... --restamp`. |
| **make a STRIP** (2 to 4 panels in one image: a hero that argues in beats) | `compose-strip/scripts/strip.py` — a `strip.json` spec, then `plan`, `render --panel`, `judge --panel --roll --verdict` (a defect needs `--reason`, add a `--counter`), `compose --export <wiki webp> --export-asset static/img/...`, `stage --manifest`. **Never write a `compose.py` beside a work again**: four did on 2026-09-25 and every recipe failed the wiki's provenance gate. This one validates the recipe against the gate's rules before writing it. |
| **record that a picture was displayed** | You do not. `shot_board.py served` is called BY the frapp from inside the response that sent the bytes; there is no verb for "I showed them", on purpose. |
| **check what still blocks a lock** | `shoot-references/scripts/shot_board.py status <pngs>` — exits non-zero while anything is unlockable and names why. |
| **backfill prompts onto old plates** | `shoot-references/scripts/backfill_prompts.py` |
| **judge a slot against its golden** | `judge-slot/scripts/judge.py` |
| **record or change an approved sentence** (a tagline, the one-line answer to "what is this", a credential) | `abu line-add` / `line-bless` / `line-reword` / `line-retire` (engine verbs), listed by `abu lines <universe>`. Never hand-edit `canon/craft/brand-lines.json`: the verbs keep version and history true and roll back a write `validate` would refuse. |
| **voice-check a manuscript before locking** | `voice-gate/scripts/voice_gate.py <universe> <manuscript.md>` — rules fetched from https://garysheng.com/voice.md; fails on unadjudicated findings, waivable with a written reason |
| **find what a session hand-rolled** | `pave-the-path/scripts/detect_handroll.py [dir]` from ANY directory (default: the cwd); `--since <ref>` scans only the scripts a git diff touched, so a consuming repo (books platform, a site, a print export) can run it as a pre-commit or CI step |
| **install the framework for someone** | `onboard/scripts/install.py` |
| **check whether this is a KNOWN gap** (before you work around one) | `gh issue list --label gap` — the standing register of found-and-proven, not-yet-closed gaps, with the verb that would close each one. Search it before hand-rolling around something, and `gh issue create --label gap` when you decline to build. Was `docs/GAPS.md` until 2026-09-12; all 50 entries are issues now, carrying their original G-ids in their titles, so `gh issue list --search G38` still finds one. |
| **render one spread** | `compose-spread/scripts/render_spread.py` |
| **decide where each caption sits** | THE VISION PASS, not the heuristic: the platform's `scripts/caption-vision.ts --slug <slug> --apply` (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Code computes each anchor's REAL footprint from the real caption text at the real font size; the model judges what is under it. `compose-spread/scripts/pick_caption_pos.py` is a free PRIOR only and it has two proven failure modes: it cannot tell a face from a chandelier (skin is smooth, so a face scores CALM), and it is structurally biased toward `top` (bottom pays a flip penalty, top pays none, so bottom only wins when it is a third calmer). Both cost a shipped book. Add `--full-width-only` if you use the prior, because the corner anchors cap at 44% width and silently change the caption's SHAPE. |
| **render / compile / conform a cover** | `cover/scripts/render_cover.py`, `compile_cover.py`, `conform_cover.py` — `render_cover.py --out .../cover-raw.png` ALSO publishes `cover.png` + its recipe (v0.33). **Never `cp cover-raw.png cover.png`**; the hand copy failed `book-doctor` on `provenance cover.png` until its sidecar was hand-copied too. |
| **make an explanatory plate** (diagram-style) | `explanatory-plate/scripts/plate.py` |

Engine verbs (`python3 -m agenticstory.cli <verb>` from `engine/`):
`validate` · `list` · `list-craft` · `assert-story` · `assert-spread` · `lock-level` ·
`wardrobe` · `lock-shot` · `archive` · `import-asset` · `add-entity` · `add-look` · `build-canon` ·
`build-docs` · `backfill-provenance` · `massing` · `elevation` · `land` · `init` ·
`lines` · `line-add` · `line-bless` · `line-reword` · `line-retire`

## Rendering a named person: ALWAYS use the look binding

```bash
python3 skills/on-brand-image/scripts/generate.py \
  --out <path>.png --no-open --no-wardrobe \
  --entity "<universe>:<entity>@<look-id>" \
  --prompt "<the SCENE only. Never describe the outfit.>"
```

**`@<look-id>` is the whole point.** It resolves the person's locked plates AND the look's
own `invariants`, which state the garment. Bare `--entity selah` with a hand-written outfit
description is how a blessed A-line gown came back as a fitted trumpet and blessed
straightened hair came back curly: the binding existed, was not used, and nothing complained.

**Never hand-assemble a prompt by slicing an older recipe.** A `.split("SETTING:")[0]` on a
previous prompt silently dropped an entire dress description, and the render looked plausible
enough that only the owner caught it. If the look is bound, the words come from canon.

Looks bound in `christofuturism` today:

| Pass this | Wears |
|---|---|
| `gary@usa-flag-jacket` | American-flag leather bomber |
| `gary@texas-denim` | denim trucker with the Proof of Vibes patch |
| `gary@at-home-loungewear` | silk pyjamas, indoors only, no pendant |
| `selah@wedding-dress` | ivory lace A-line, two hair sheets (below) |
| `selah@usa-flag-dress` | American-flag fit-and-flare |
| `selah@at-home-robe` | silk wrap robe, indoors only |

A look may carry EXTRA SHEETS beyond `look`. `selah@wedding-dress` has
`hair-curls-down` and `hair-ironed-side`; name the one you want in the prompt, or the model
picks. A look may also `supersede` a base invariant, which is how the ironed style is legal
inside that look and nowhere else.

**`structured.render.always` is honoured here.** It is prompt-craft that applies to every
render of an entity: register, staging, standing composition. `compose-spread` always read
it and `on-brand-image` did not until v0.29, so the same field was live in one renderer and
inert in the other, and a canon edit could look correct while steering nothing. Put standing
STAGING there; put facts about the body in `invariants`, where a readback can check them.

**TWO OR MORE PEOPLE IN ONE FRAME:** `--entity` is repeatable and every entity's plates,
invariants and negatives merge. Landscape `1536x1024` suits two figures, portrait suits one.
Three things that are not obvious and each cost real renders:

- **State "EXACTLY ONE of each person in frame, never duplicated."** Multi-person renders
  duplicate a face otherwise. At least one universe's craft canon already forbids this and
  nothing enforced it.
- **Name each person's ethnicity in the scene line** when they differ, or one drifts toward
  the other across a batch.
- **Never dress them in a matching set.** Same palette family and formality, cut for each
  separately. Matching reads as costume; a shared register reads as one household. Two
  re-shoots were caused by this: an emerald dress beside a forest-green suit, and cream
  beside cream. Related means several shades apart in value AND saturation.

Opposing invariants resolve correctly and can be trusted: a pair render where one entity's
canon asserts a chest patch and the other's forbids one produces exactly that asymmetry with
neither mentioned in the prompt.

**Verify before you look at the image**, with the script, not by eye:

```bash
python3 skills/render-readback/scripts/verify_render.py <out>.png \
  --expect "selah@wedding-dress"           # asserts the LOOK bound, not just the person
```

It checks that the recipe exists, that the invariant block reached the prompt, that the
entity AND look you meant are the ones that resolved, and that the frame is not pure black.
It exits non-zero, so it can gate a loop. These were two paste-in one-liners in this file
until 2026-08-02, and a check you paste is a check you skip: between them they had already
caught four silent binding bypasses and two dead frames, and were still being retyped by
hand. **`--expect selah` does NOT satisfy `--expect selah@wedding-dress`** — matching the
id alone is exactly how the bare-entity bug stayed invisible.

**To prove a look is BOUND, render a scene that never names the clothes**, and let the
script check the scene text too:

```bash
python3 skills/render-readback/scripts/verify_render.py <out>.png \
  --expect "selah@wedding-dress-highneck" --scene "$SCENE"
```

If the garment words are in the prompt, the render proves nothing: it shows the model can
follow instructions, which was never in doubt. Add the look's own hero words with
`--forbid`, since only you know what this look is made of.

## The rule this file encodes

**Discoverability is a just-in-time problem, not a documentation problem.** Anything that
depends on having read something earlier and remembered it fails on a long session. The
plugin description is ~6,900 characters loaded once at session start; by hour six it has
lost to whatever is in front of you. So:

- When you add a script, **add its row here**, in the words someone would search for.
- When a skill's method should call a script, **name the script inside that method**, not
  only here. The `fashion-look` form's `PROMPT.md` does this and it is the pattern.
- Prefer a tool that **refuses loudly at the moment of misuse** over a doc that explains the
  right way. `validate` catching a bad wardrobe key taught faster than any prose.

## Proving a test bites

When you add a test for existing behaviour, revert the behaviour and confirm the test
fails. A test written against code that already passes proves only that it compiles.

**Assert the mutation actually applied.** Patch by string replacement and the string will
eventually not match — a comment between two lines is enough — and the run then reports the
mutation as SURVIVED when nothing was ever mutated. That reads as "the test is weak" and
sends you rewriting a test that was fine. It happened on 2026-08-02:

```python
assert old in src, "PATCH DID NOT MATCH"   # without this the no-op is silent
```

Same family as every other bug in this file: a check that did not run looks exactly like a
check that passed.

## Standing gotchas

- **Never `uv run --with pillow` a skill script.** Every PIL-dependent script declares
  pillow inline (PEP 723, `# /// script`), so `uv run <script>` resolves it by itself;
  plain `python3` needs Pillow on the env. If you catch yourself typing `--with pillow`,
  the script you are running is missing its block — add it, do not work around it.
- **zsh eats `"$VAR:id"`** as a parameter modifier, so `--entity "$CF:gary"` silently
  mangles the path. Build it first: `ENT="${CF}:gary"`, then pass `"$ENT"`.
- **zsh does NOT word-split an unquoted `$VAR`, so `shoot $pair` passes ONE argument.**
  A shoot loop written as `for p in "face 1024x1024" ...; do shoot $p; done` hands the
  whole string to `$1` and leaves `$2` empty, and the renders fail with a usage error
  rather than anything that names the cause. Loop over explicit pairs
  (`shoot face-neutral 1024x1024`) or use an array and `"${a[@]}"`. Cost six renders on
  2026-09-06, and the same rule has already been earned once in `open-in-preview`, which
  is a skill that never loads during a shoot.
- **Never rewrite a historical record.** `.recipe.json` files and dated canon attestations
  state what actually ran. Change live INSTRUCTIONS; leave every ATTESTATION alone, even
  when it points at a file that has since been deleted.

## Provenance invariants (each was a bug, each is now enforced)

- **A recorded transform is a PERFORMED transform.** `import-asset --crop` used to
  `shutil.copy2` the original while writing `transform.crop` into the recipe from the
  caller's argument, so the provenance asserted an edit that never happened. It now crops
  or REFUSES, including when Pillow is missing or the box does not fit the source. A false
  record is worse than none: it passes an audit.
- **A recipe records the output geometry it asked for.** `--size` and `--quality` were
  forwarded to the provider and never written down, so a reader could not tell an intended
  aspect from a provider default.
- **DECLARED is not PASSED, so a recipe states both.** The entity block recorded
  `photoStack` from canon whether or not the photographs were sent. Since `--entity-photos`
  is OFF by default, the ordinary recipe listed a stack that never reached the provider,
  and anyone auditing what conditioned a render would conclude it did. Now
  `photoStackDeclared` and `photoStackPassed` are separate fields. The general rule: when a
  record can state either what canon SAYS or what the run DID, and they can differ, it must
  say which one it is saying.
