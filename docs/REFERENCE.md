# Reference

Every table on this page is **generated** from the thing it describes. Do not hand-edit inside the
`BEGIN GENERATED` / `END GENERATED` fences: `abu build-docs` overwrites them, and
`build-docs --check` (which runs inside `./run-tests.sh`) fails the suite when they drift.

To change a row, change its source. The skill table comes from each `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter,
the CLI table from the real argument parser, the agent and command tables from `agents/*.md` and
`commands/*.md` frontmatter, the provider table from `registry/providers.json`, the form table from
`forms/*/form.json`, and the changelog from `SPEC.md`.

The generator enumerates whole DIRECTORIES rather than named surfaces, so adding an agent or a
command is enough to document it. That is deliberate: the `abu-steward` subagent shipped for two
months in no generated table, because this page knew only about `skills/`, and a surface no doc
mentions may as well not exist.

For the narrative introduction see [`../README.md`](../README.md); for the architecture see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md); for the contract itself see [`../SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md).

## Skills

The framework is used mostly through these. They are universe-agnostic: each takes the target
universe or style pack as a parameter and hardcodes nothing about any particular one.

If you are new, the two that need no universe are `create-style-pack` and `on-brand-image` — a look
plus a gate is the smallest useful slice of the framework, and it is enough to make a zine, a deck,
or a set of page heroes without ever declaring canon.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: skills -->
| Skill | What it does | Tested |
|---|---|---|
| `abu` | THE FRONT DOOR to Agentic Brand Universe. | yes |
| `add-character` | Add ONE character to an Agentic Brand Universe: interview the source (a real person's story/wardrobe/sensitive-list, or a fictional design brief), reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `character` entity with the SPEC §12 reference-matrix slots (8 shots) and a ready-to-run generation prompt per shot. | yes |
| `add-generator` | Add ONE deterministic generator to a universe (SPEC v0.13 §4.11) — code that DRAWS an asset instead of prompting for one. |  |
| `add-motif` | Add ONE motif (a recurring visual element, gesture, or pattern that must render identically wherever it appears, not a one-off image) to an Agentic Brand Universe (interview what it is and its load-bearing detail, reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `motif` entity with SPEC §12's hero + detail reference slots and ready-to-run generation prompts). |  |
| `add-or-update-line` | Record ONE golden line (one approved unit of a brand's language - a tagline, the one-sentence answer to "what is this", a positioning paragraph, a credential, a definition) into a universe's lines record (SPEC 13.2, craft-canon kind `lines`), or change one - bless a candidate, give a golden line new words while keeping every earlier wording, or retire it naming what to say instead - always with who said yes, when and in what words. |  |
| `add-piece-or-no-go` | Record ONE brand PIECE (a reusable part of the brand with its exact recipe, or a pointer to the canon that already defines it - a selection state, a button, a thread of stripes, a section marker, a mark at a size) or ONE NO-GO (a thing the brand refuses, why, and the piece to use instead) into a universe's kit record (SPEC 13.1, craft-canon kind `kit`), with who decided it, when and in what words. |  |
| `add-prop` | Add ONE prop (a discrete physical object a character holds, wears, or uses, that must render identically wherever it appears) to an Agentic Brand Universe (interview what it is and its load-bearing detail, reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `prop` entity with SPEC §12's hero + detail reference slots and ready-to-run generation prompts). |  |
| `add-relation` | Record ONE typed relation between two ids in an Agentic Brand Universe's canon graph (`crossover-with`, `appears-in`, `derived-from`, `contradicts`, `supersedes`) as a `from`/`rel`/`to`/`story`/`note` record written to `canon/relations/`. |  |
| `add-setting` | Add ONE setting (a location) to an Agentic Brand Universe (interview its fixed geometry, fixed camera angles, and dressing, reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `setting` entity with SPEC §12's contract slots (turnaround, per-angle empty plates, blueprint, plus map/blocking/dressing descriptor prose) and ready-to-run generation prompts). |  |
| `add-story` | Add ONE story to an Agentic Brand Universe as a typed StorySpec (a medium-neutral work over canon, NOT an `add-entity` kind). |  |
| `add-visual-metaphor` | Add ONE visual metaphor (a spine-object a whole property argues through, not merely a location) to an Agentic Brand Universe (interview the object and the states it argues across, reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `visual-metaphor` entity with SPEC §12's setting-style contract: a locked master plus per-state plates, and map/blocking/dressing descriptor prose). |  |
| `approve-works` | Put a BATCH OF WORKS in front of the operator for approval on their phone, one batch per page, and record what they decide about each. | yes |
| `book-doctor` | Grade a RENDERED book on local disk against what its render-spec declares, BEFORE it is delivered anywhere. | yes |
| `canon-resolve` | Before writing ANY render prompt in an Agentic Brand Universe, resolve every named character, setting, and motif to its canon entity: output the locked sheet paths (requiredForRender), the invariants to enforce, and the entity's prose rules, then run the load-bearing gate (assert.sh spread\|story). |  |
| `casting-sweep` | Before naming any NEW character, setting, or motif in a story, sweep the universe's canon for an existing entity that fits the role natively, and emit a casting table (each role: reuse an entity id, or NEW plus a one-line justification). |  |
| `compose-spec` | Scaffold and RE-SYNC a book's render-spec from its StorySpec, filling everything canon determines, enumerating every legal choice canon constrains, and never overwriting authored scene text. | yes |
| `compose-spread` | Render ONE spread of an Agentic Brand Universe book as an atomic unit — resolve canon, deterministically ASSEMBLE the prompt + refs from canon (register-anchor-first, each in-frame entity's block for its SELECTED look including alt-looks, auto-disambiguation, and negatives COMPUTED from the selected looks so a blanket negative can never fight a canon alt-look), generate, then read back. | yes |
| `compose-strip` | Compose a STRIP, two to four panels (three by default) assembled into ONE image, from a spec file instead of a prose brief. | yes |
| `cover` | Create a picture-book cover for a story in an Agentic Brand Universe, at the platform's portrait aspect. | yes |
| `create-form` | Author a NEW form (a new KIND of work) for an Agentic Brand Universe, extracted from works ACTUALLY MADE, never speculated. | yes |
| `create-lookbook` | Scaffold a Lookbook (SPEC §4.7.1) — a portable folder (lookbook.json + refs/) that defines a curated but intentionally VARIED visual vocabulary (a wardrobe/fashion, a range of building silhouettes, a set of faces), the complement of a Style Pack. | yes |
| `create-style-pack` | Scaffold a Style Pack (SPEC §4.7) — a portable folder (pack.json + refs/) that defines ONE look and is consumable by on-brand-image with no universe. | yes |
| `evolve-abu` | Evolve the Agentic Brand Universe framework itself — its skills, engine, spec, templates, and plugin — instead of hand-rolling around its gaps. | yes |
| `explore` | Render a comparison SET that isolates one variable, so a human can decide a visual question by looking instead of by reading a description. | yes |
| `explore-a-personal-brand` | Turn a person's sense of how their pages should look into a real brand universe they approved by looking at it. |  |
| `judge-slot` | Judge one generated slot against an entity's locked golden, item by item over its declared invariants, in a context that has NOT been told how the slot was made. |  |
| `land-work` | Merge a finished work branch home instead of leaving it parked, in ANY git repo (a universe, a platform repo, a site, anything). |  |
| `lint-universe` | Lint a brand universe. Static checks over the universe and everything it declares (style packs, entities, goldens, provenance, craft canon, provider quirks) with no generation, no API calls, and no cost. | yes |
| `make-a-book` | The base orchestrator for making an illustrated, narrated picture book in ANY Agentic Brand Universe universe. | yes |
| `make-a-playable-deck` | Build a mobile-friendly PLAYABLE slide deck from slides declared as data, for sending someone an argument they can sit with on their phone. | yes |
| `make-a-work` | Make ONE work in a form a universe already declares — a flyer, a card, a poster, a scene, whatever forms/ holds. | yes |
| `on-brand-image` | Generate ONE on-brand image from a Style Pack (SPEC §4.7) — a portable folder of style references plus a read-back gate — with NO universe required. | yes |
| `onboard` | Install Agentic Brand Universe for someone, as a conversation rather than a list of commands they have to run. |  |
| `pave-the-path` | The retrospective sweep at the END of a chain run. | yes |
| `render-book` | Render a story from an Agentic Brand Universe into a picture book. |  |
| `render-readback` | After EVERY render in an Agentic Brand Universe, read the image back and crop-zoom each of the in-frame entity's invariants, returning a per-invariant PASS or DEFECT verdict. | yes |
| `reroll-slot` | Re-roll ONE already-rendered slot (a spread, cover, closing plate, or any asset with a .recipe.json beside it) as its recipe records — same prompt, same refs, and the recorded model unless that model is superseded, in which case the adapter's current one — with an optional one-line delta, in one command and one image call, reading ZERO canon. | yes |
| `shoot-references` | SHOOT an entity's reference matrix in an Agentic Brand Universe: make the art that gives a scaffolded entity a body. | yes |
| `start-new-story-universe` | Stand up a brand-new story universe on the Agentic Brand Universe framework — a typed, git-versioned canon with a load-bearing pre-render gate, conforming to a named spec version. |  |
| `universe-doctor` | Grade how COMPLETE and how HIGH-QUALITY an Agentic Brand Universe is, then work the punch-list. | yes |
| `update-book` | Edit or extend an existing picture book in an Agentic Brand Universe: add, insert, revise, or remove a spread (insert_spread.py), RECAST one canon entity as another across a whole story (recast_story.py), renumber, and regenerate only the touched art + narration. | yes |
| `voice-gate` | Run a voice check on any manuscript, narration script, or overlaid caption text BEFORE it is locked or rendered to audio, in an Agentic Brand Universe. | yes |

## CLI

The engine. Stdlib only, no network, no API key, and it generates no images: it types canon,
answers questions about it, and refuses renders whose references do not exist on disk.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: cli -->
| Verb | What it does |
|---|---|
| `add-entity` | scaffold a schema-valid entity stub with reference-matrix slots |
| `add-look` | author an alt-look (an era, a wardrobe state) on an entity, with a face source it cannot render without |
| `archive` | retire an entity from NEW casting (history keeps rendering) |
| `archived` | list retired entities, or who still casts them |
| `assert-spread` | the pre-render gate for ONE spread's cast and location |
| `assert-story` | the pre-render gate: refuse a story whose cast lacks real art on disk |
| `backfill-prompts` | recover a scaffolded prompts.md from the recipes beside it, so a matrix shot outside the framework still records its prompts |
| `backfill-provenance` | record provenance for art that predates the adapter, without regenerating it (never invokes a model) |
| `build-canon` | regenerate CANON.md from canon/properties + canon/crossovers |
| `build-docs` | regenerate the framework's own derived docs (README + docs/REFERENCE.md) |
| `check-kit` | refuse a surface whose source files use a no-go the kit can detect |
| `check-share` | refuse a page with no share card of its own, or wearing another page's card (any site, no universe) |
| `crossovers` | list the crossovers an entity appears in |
| `elevation` | render an OBJECT's blueprint as a code-built 2D elevation sheet from a declarative spec (deterministic, no model, no cost) |
| `import-asset` | bring an asset made OUTSIDE this universe INTO it, writing its provenance chain as a side effect of the copy |
| `init` | scaffold a new universe (conforms to spec v0.63) |
| `kit` | list the brand's pieces and no-gos (SPEC §13.1 kit records) |
| `land` | merge a finished work branch home, or queue it if that is not safe yet |
| `line-add` | add a golden line: a candidate, or golden when it arrives with --by and --verbatim |
| `line-bless` | a person's yes makes a candidate line golden |
| `line-retire` | retire a line, naming the line to say instead |
| `line-reword` | give a line new words; a golden line keeps its old wording and goes up a version |
| `lines` | list the brand's golden lines (SPEC §13.2 lines records) |
| `list` | list every entity in a universe |
| `list-craft` | list a universe's craft-canon records |
| `lock-level` | report how locked an entity is (which matrix slots are filled) |
| `lock-shot` | lock a generated reference shot into an entity |
| `massing` | render a setting's blueprint as a code-built 3D massing sheet from a declarative spec (deterministic, no model, no cost) |
| `massing-scaffold` | write a STARTER massing spec for a rectangular room (shell + opposed cameras + notes stub) to edit, so authoring a blueprint does not start from a blank file |
| `relations` | list an entity's typed relations |
| `report` | file what ABU got wrong: prints (or --open opens) a pre-filled GitHub issue; nothing is sent until you press submit |
| `seed` | write a brand direction into a scaffolded universe (palette, type, mark, brief, surfaces) |
| `unarchive` | put a retired entity back in service |
| `validate` | typecheck a universe against the spec schema |
| `wardrobe` | resolve what named characters are WEARING: which lookbooks apply, their aesthetic, variety rules, negatives and gate |
<!-- END GENERATED: cli -->

## Agents

Subagents the plugin ships. An agent is not a verb you call but a **context you hand work to**, which
is the point: the main context is carrying a build's momentum and is therefore the worst judge of
"should I write a quick script here." A fresh context whose only question is "which framework verb is
this" has no such incentive, and has not spent an hour becoming attached to a plan.

Dispatch one with the Agent tool, `subagent_type: "abu:<agent>"`. `/abu:steward` is the shorthand.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: agents -->
| Agent | What it is for | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| `abu-steward` | Framework-aware steward for ANY Agentic Brand Universe work — building or growing a typed, git-versioned, self-contained canon (agenticbranduniverse.com). | `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit, Write, Skill, TodoWrite` |
<!-- END GENERATED: agents -->

## Commands

Slash commands. These are thin on purpose: a command is an **entry point**, not a place for logic. It
resolves what you meant and hands off to the skill or agent that owns the work, so the same behavior
is reachable whether you typed the command, asked in plain language, or arrived through a chain.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: commands -->
| Command | Takes | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/abu:steward` | `[the task, e.g. "add the forge setting to nation-of-fire"]` | Hand a framework-shaped task to the abu-steward subagent instead of hand-rolling it |
<!-- END GENERATED: commands -->

## Forms

A **form** is what makes a work the KIND of thing it is; a **work** is one made thing, canon given
form. The concepts survive; the v0.6–v0.16 encoding of them (a typed contract of surface, required
kinds, slots and generators, plus the universal composer that executed it) was **retired in v0.17**
having produced zero works, and the `add-form` / `add-work` verbs went with it. No replacement schema
is written until a second composer is proven — see SPEC §4.8, §4.9 and §4.10. The table below lists
whatever forms this repo still ships, and is empty when it ships none.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: forms -->
| Form | Medium | What it is |
|---|---|---|
<!-- END GENERATED: forms -->

## Providers

Provider knowledge, not brand knowledge: what a specific model gets reliably wrong regardless of
what you are making. It attaches to the provider, so every universe benefits when one project learns
something.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: providers -->
| Provider | Recorded quirks |
|---|---|
| `gpt-image-2` | 4 |
| `midjourney` | 1 |
<!-- END GENERATED: providers -->

## Spec changelog

Headlines only, parsed from `SPEC.md`. Read the spec for the full text of any entry.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: spec-changelog -->

|---|---|
| v0.62 | where a look may be used, typed; an explore pick becomes a pack in one > command; a set is judged at its real size; a provider finds its own key. |
| v0.61 | the LINES: a universe holds its brand's approved language, with every > wording it has had. |
| v0.60 | the KIT: a universe catalogs its brand's pieces and no-gos, and a gate > reads the no-gos. |
| v0.59 | a universe declares the SURFACE ROLES a renderer outside it paints in. |
| v0.58 | a PREFERRED TERM is a voice rule the gate enforces. |
| v0.57 | reuse what already draws it, never redraw it from prose. |

| v0.55 | gap-register sweep, batch 2: declared vocabulary instead of literals. |
| v0.54 | one register resolver for every tool, and a gap-register sweep. |
| v0.53 | a STRIP is a spec, and its one recipe passes a wiki's provenance gate by > construction. |
| v0.52 | a batch of WORKS is approved on a board too, and no board shows what > is not a current candidate. |
| v0.51 | the board SHOWS the art, because an `AskUserQuestion` preview is > TEXT. |
| v0.50 | what COUNTS as an operator having seen a shot, and the half of the > no-command rule a gate cannot see. |
| v0.49 | three rules that were written as gates and enforced only by prose. |
| v0.48 | a prompt guard that fires is also a read-back assertion. |
| v0.47 | the board of next moves. |
| v0.46 | binding an entity inherits its guard. |
| v0.45 | a pack can require an entity. |
| v0.44 | a re-roll no longer destroys good art. |
| v0.43 | a scale plate can now be MADE, and two people can be the measure > (§12). |

| v0.33 | three surfaces that each assumed a name meant a thing. |
| v0.32 | three compilers passed the same anchor and only two obeyed the same > law. |
| v0.31 | the `visual-metaphor` was a second-class kind, and four surfaces > proved it in one book run. |
| v0.30 | two checks that fired at the wrong time, both from one book run. |
| v0.29 | five checks that were lying, all earned in one book run. |
| v0.28 | lookbooks became real, and clothes got attached to people. |
| v0.27 | a standard for when a REAL PERSON is reproducible. |
| v0.29 | a setting may be `partOf` another setting. |
| v0.26 | `supersedes` now covers the negatives it always claimed to. |
| v0.25 | a shot can name WHICH of another entity's sheets it needs. |
| v0.24 | a lock may raise a gate and must never lower one. |
| v0.23 | a reference slot can say what it CONTRIBUTES, a negative can name one > person, and a multi-line header stops being half-read. |
| v0.22 | a character must be able to prove its own height, and so must an object. |
| v0.21 | an asset from OUTSIDE arrives with its chain (`abu import-asset`), and the > photo-stack rule stops existing twice. |
| v0.18 | a VARIANT may declare WHICH ERA it is legal in. |
| v0.17 | the slot-model composer is RETIRED, having never run. |
| v0.19 | an entity has a LIFECYCLE, so canon can be RETIRED without rewriting history. |
| v0.19 | a setting may declare a BLOCKING PLATE. |
| v0.15 | a setting's blueprint is a CODE-BUILT 3D MASSING RENDER. |
| v0.14 | Projection/Composition become Form/Work. |
| v0.13 | deterministic graphics get a typed home. |
| v0.12 | text is gated, not banned. |
| v0.10 | a character must be able to prove its own scale, and its future. |
