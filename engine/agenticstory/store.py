"""
Agentic Brand Universe — canon store.

Loads a universe directory into a queryable in-memory graph of entities and
relations. A universe is:

    <universe>/
      universe.json                 # { "name", "assetRoot" }  assetRoot is where entity asset paths resolve
      canon/entities/*.json         # one Entity per file
      canon/relations/*.json        # one Relation per file (or a list)
      forms/*/form.json             # Form per directory  (RETIRED encoding, SPEC §4.8)
      works/*/work.json             # Work per directory  (RETIRED encoding, SPEC §4.9)
      stories/*.json                # StorySpec per file  (SPEC §4.3 — the LIVE primitive)

The form/work loaders below are kept so a universe written against v0.6-v0.16 still
loads and typechecks. Their encoding was retired in v0.17 having produced zero works,
and no replacement is specified: see SPEC §4.8/§4.9. StorySpec is NOT an alias for a
work whose form is storybook; that migration was recorded as done and never happened,
so §4.3 is canonical for stories.

Stdlib only.
