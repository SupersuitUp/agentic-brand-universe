"""The framework's OWN docs as a DERIVED artifact.

`canonfile` made a universe's CANON.md a projection of its record store, because a
hand-maintained shared file drifts and git cannot catch it. The framework's own
documentation had exactly the same disease and no cure: on 2026-07-30 the public
README claimed spec v0.6 while SPEC.md was v0.16, claimed "165 tests across seven
skill suites" against a real 541 across 16, and taught two layer names ("Projection",
"Composition") that v0.14 had renamed to Form and Work. Every one of those numbers
was true when it was typed. That is the whole problem: prose asserts a fact once and
then rots silently while the thing it describes keeps moving.

So the same fix applies one level up. Anything whose truth already lives in a file is
GENERATED between fences; only judgement is hand-written. The generated blocks:

  status         (README.md)        versions + counts, the facts that rot fastest
  skills         (docs/REFERENCE.md) every skills/*/SKILL.md, by frontmatter
  cli            (docs/REFERENCE.md) every verb, by introspecting the real parser
  agents         (docs/REFERENCE.md) every agents/*.md, by frontmatter
  commands       (docs/REFERENCE.md) every commands/*.md, by frontmatter
  providers      (docs/REFERENCE.md) registry/providers.json
  forms          (docs/REFERENCE.md) forms/*/form.json
  spec-changelog (docs/REFERENCE.md) the v0.N changelog headlines in SPEC.md
  report         (skills/*/SKILL.md) the misfire-report step, in every skill
  running-abu    (skills/*/SKILL.md) the not-on-PATH fallback, in every skill whose
                                     own prose runs `abu <verb>`

and one derived file that carries no fences, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, whose
entry description is projected wholesale from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Agents and commands were added on 2026-08-01 for a reason worth recording, because it
is this module's own thesis turned on itself. The plugin had shipped an `abu-steward`
subagent since 0.5x that no generated doc mentioned, because this file enumerated
`skills/` and nothing else. Undocumented is close to unreachable: it was invoked zero
times across a full book session in which the main agent hand-rolled five shoot
scripts the framework already owned. The fix was NOT to write a paragraph about the
steward. A surface the generator cannot see will be forgotten again the moment someone
adds the next one, so the generator learned to see whole directories instead.

`check()` is the half that matters. Regenerating docs is a convenience; FAILING when
they are stale is the mechanism, which is why `build-docs --check` runs inside
`run-tests.sh`. Documentation you have to remember to refresh is not documentation,
for the same reason provenance you have to remember to save is not provenance.

It also enforces one cross-file invariant prose cannot: SPEC.md's version and the
engine's SPEC_VERSION must agree. They are bumped by hand in two files and the
comment in `__init__.py` asking for lockstep is not a mechanism.
