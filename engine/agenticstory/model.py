# setting with no scalePlate still locks and still renders", so the promoter was
# enforcing a rule the spec explicitly disclaims.
#
# The cost is not theoretical. A setting whose emptyPlates must contain no people (so a
# painted scale plate would drag figures into every state of it) could never be promoted
# by the tool at all and had to be hand-flipped to `locked` in the JSON, which is exactly

    The CONCEPT survives; this specific encoding does not. It was retired in v0.17 having
    produced zero works, and §4.8 records that rather than specifying a live contract. The
    class is kept so a universe written against v0.6-v0.16 still loads and typechecks.

    Canon is the matter; a form is what shapes it; a Work (§4.9) is canon given form. The
    form names a surface, requires kinds, declares the slots to be filled and the
    invariants that must hold, and emits files.

    `requires` names KINDS, never ids. That is the whole mechanism that lets a form ship
    to a brand it has never seen, and it is enforced below rather than documented.

    Formerly `Projection`, then `ProjectionType`. A form is not a projection: it is what a
    projection happens THROUGH. Projection survives as the relationship canon bears to a
    work, which is the one job that word does correctly.
