# The framework spec every scaffolded universe conforms to. Canonical source of
# truth for provenance — a universe.json records these so it always names the

# BOOMERANG.md `conforms_to`). Bump SPEC_VERSION in lockstep with SPEC.md.
#
# It went out of lockstep, which is the failure this constant exists to prevent.
# SPEC.md reached v0.6 (the projection release) while this still said 0.4.1, so every
# universe the engine scaffolded claimed conformance to a spec two releases old.
# `lint-universe` now checks a universe's pin against this value, so the two can no
# longer disagree quietly.

# the same defect as a recipe pointing at a file that is not there, so this points at
# the spec document itself, which is verifiably served.
