# Cut a release. ONE command, and it refuses rather than half-shipping.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The repo IS the marketplace (`source: "."`), and Claude Code's marketplace
# source format carries no ref, so an install always tracks the DEFAULT BRANCH. Verified
# 2026-09-12 by reading an installed marketplace record. That means every commit on master was
# a release to every user, with no staging and nothing immutable to point at: `git tag`
# returned nothing, so a report of "broken since" had no ref to name and the version string in
# plugin.json pointed at a moving branch head.
#
# So: develop is where work lands, master is what ships, and a release is a deliberate act
# that leaves a tag behind.
#
#   ./release.sh 1.24.0            cut it
#   ./release.sh 1.24.0 --dry-run  say what would happen and touch nothing
