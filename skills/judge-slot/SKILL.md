name: judge-slot
description: Judge one generated slot against an entity's locked golden, item by item over its declared invariants, in a context that has NOT been told how the slot was made. A ROLE, not a service: fill it with a subagent, a fresh session, a human, or simply another turn inside the composer. Returns PASS or DEFECT per invariant with evidence, and fails closed. Use after generating any slot bound to a canon entity that declares invariants.

# Judge Slot

The runner for `judged` invariants (SPEC §4.10). Without it, a `judged` rule is a wish.

## This is a role, not a service

The load-bearing property is **the judge has not seen the plan**. That is a fact about context, not
about transport. Anything that can look at two images with a clean context can fill the role:

| Filled by | When |
|---|---|
| **Another turn inside the composer** | The production case. The agent already has model access, so a verification step scoped to golden + slot + checklist is a message, not infrastructure. **This costs nothing extra.** |
| A subagent or a fresh session | Interactive work, where the maker is still holding the plan |
| A person | Cheapest of all, and the most reliable. A human who never saw the intent spots drift in one glance |
| `scripts/judge.py` | Only when judging out-of-band, outside any agent runtime |

The script is the LEAST interesting implementation and exists for completeness. Reaching for it first
is the mistake this file was rewritten to correct: it invents an external dependency for something the
runtime already does.

## The protocol

Give the judge exactly three things, and nothing else:

1. The **locked golden** for the entity.
2. The **generated slot**.
3. The entity's **declared invariants**, verbatim, as a checklist.

Withhold the prompt, the intent, the plan, and what anyone hoped the slot would look like.

Ask for a verdict **per invariant**, each with one sentence of evidence describing what is visible in
the slot versus the golden.

## Three rules, each earned

- **The judge never sees the plan.** A maker shown its own reasoning defends it instead of inspecting
  the pixels. A three-element graphic once shipped with one element missing its defining feature
  because the maker read its own intent; an observer with no access to the plan caught it instantly.
- **Itemized, never gestalt.** Check each declared invariant separately. Asked "is this the same
  character?" a judge says yes while a declared property is plainly violated. Measured on a locked
  mascot: ten of twelve invariants held, and `translucent-holographic-digital-being` failed in every
  slot, rendering as opaque felt. The gestalt question passes that. The itemized one does not.
- **Against the golden, never slot-to-slot.** Slots drift together, inheriting the same drift from the
  same master-to-generation step. Compared with each other they look consistent and are uniformly
  wrong. **Consistency is not fidelity.**

**Fail closed.** Unparseable output is not a pass, and "I cannot tell" is a DEFECT, never a PASS.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:judge-slot

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
