description: Scaffold a Style Pack (SPEC §4.7) — a portable folder (pack.json + refs/) that defines ONE look and is consumable by on-brand-image with no universe. Use when you have a set of blessed images that share a look and want to make more that match (a register's paint-language extracted into a reusable artifact), or when a universe's register should source its anchor + rejected poles from a shared pack. Copies the refs INTO the pack (self-contained), writes the manifest with a load-bearing read-back gate, and validates. Pairs with on-brand-image (which consumes the pack) and shoot-references (locked masters passed alongside). Invoke via create-style-pack, "make a style pack", "extract this look into a pack", or as the fix when you catch yourself generating on-brand images with no pack (a look with no Style Pack is the gap evolve-agentic-story names).

# Create Style Pack

Turn a blessed set of images into a **Style Pack** (SPEC §4.7): `pack.json` + `refs/`. This is the artifact `on-brand-image` consumes, and the thing to build the moment you notice you are generating "in a look" by re-typing the same style words each time. The look lives in the **references**, not the wording; the pack makes that reusable and gated.

## Inputs you need first

- **3-8 blessed reference images** that share the look. Fewer than 3 and the model has too little to lock onto; more than 8 and you are curating, not defining. Prefer at least one **content-neutral** image as the `anchor` (a swatch of palette + light + finish with no subject), because a reference outranks negative words and a busy anchor leaks its content into every render (the Nation of Fire lesson: a style anchor must never depict a canon character).
- **The style line** — one sentence naming the look (medium, line, fills, light, finish).
- **Palette** — ground / fill / line colors (hex).
- **The pack's ID names the MEDIUM, never the subject.** `-painterly`, `-hyperrealistic`,
  `-illuminated`, `-inkline` all survive the subject changing; `-community`, `-fellowship`,
  `-hero` do not, because the moment you render something else with them the name lies. A pack
  selects HOW a thing is made, so name it that way, and keep the whole shelf in one grammar so a
  reader can tell at a glance that these are alternative mediums rather than a mix of medium and
  topic. (Earned renaming three Christofuturism packs at once; all three had drifted to subject
  names and none described what the pack actually was.)
- **Rejected poles** — the looks to bake as negatives (what this is NOT). **Reject a specific
  FAILURE, never a whole visual mode.** A pole broad enough to name a capability deletes that
  capability from the register, and the model cannot tell you it did: a Christofuturist pack
  rejected "glowing blue holograms", which removed augmented reality from a brand whose entire
  thesis is a Christian FUTURE, and every render came back as brass lamps and Victorian
  workbenches. Nobody could fix it by prompting harder, because the gate forbade the alternative.
  The rule that survived was narrower and truer: reject COLD BLUE sci-fi light, not AR itself.
  Before writing a pole, ask what it forbids besides the thing you dislike.
- **Gate assertions** — the read-back checklist `on-brand-image` verifies against the pixels. This is the load-bearing half; a pack without a gate is a mood board, and the scaffolder refuses to write one.

## From an explore pick (the usual way a pack is born)

When the look was chosen in `explore`, promote the pick with one command instead of copying
files by hand:

```bash
python3 ~/.../skills/create-style-pack/scripts/scaffold.py \
  --dir <universe>/reference/style/<pack-id> --id <pack-id> --name "<Name>" \
  --from-explore <explore-out-dir> --pick <direction-id> \
  --decided-by "<who picked>" [--decided-on YYYY-MM-DD] --verbatim "<the words they used>" \
  [--scope-use <book-or-site>:<role> --scope-subjects "<who it may depict>" --scope-never "<never>"] \
  --style-line "..." --reject ... --gate ... --text-policy none
```

`<explore-out-dir>` is one run or a folder of runs, one per subject. Every subject's picked roll
becomes a ref named for the subject, byte-identical with its recipe, and is BLESSED in the
picker's name; `pack.json` records `promotedFrom` (the pick, every direction considered, the
decision). A subject missing the pick is refused by name. Add `--ref` to reach the 3-8 a pack
needs, and `--anchor` if the first pick should not be the anchor.

**If the look is for some uses only, give it a scope** (`--scope-use`, repeatable). It is typed
(SPEC §4.7 v0.62): `generate.py` then refuses a render through the pack that does not say
`--use` with one of them. A look in a DIFFERENT MEDIUM from the universe's register (an
illustration inside a photographic universe) is also an exception to the register: record it in
`universe.json` `identity.register.exceptions` (SPEC §11: id, medium, stylePack, uses, decided
by/on/verbatim, why), with the same uses, or `validate` refuses. Never write a scope as a
sentence; keep the sentence as `--scope-subjects`.

## Procedure

1. **Gather + bless the refs.** Only images a human approved. If the anchor is not content-neutral, generate a content-neutral swatch first (palette + light + finish, no subject) and use that as `anchor`.

   **"A human approved it" is a claim, so RECORD it** (SPEC §4.7, v0.41). Every ref lands in the pack the same way, so nothing distinguishes one the operator blessed by name from one you swept in beside it, and the difference is not bookkeeping: the anchor is passed FIRST on every render the pack will ever make, and a reference outranks a word.

   ```bash
   python3 ~/.../skills/create-style-pack/scripts/bless_ref.py <pack> \
     --ref <name> --by "<who, when>" [--note "<what they said>"]
   python3 ~/.../skills/create-style-pack/scripts/bless_ref.py <pack> --status
   ```

   It writes `<pack>/refs/<ref>.blessed.json` bound to the ref's `sha256`, so a re-rolled ref reads **STALE** instead of quietly inheriting an approval. `--by` is required and is never defaulted to `"human"`. Partial coverage is fine and common; **reporting a half-blessed pack as blessed is not**, so run `--status` before you describe the pack to anyone.
2. **Scaffold:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.../skills/create-style-pack/scripts/scaffold.py \
     --dir <where>/reference/style/<pack-id> --id <pack-id> --name "<Name>" \
     --anchor <anchor.png> --ref <a.png> --ref <b.png> [...] \
     --style-line "<one line>" \
     --palette-ground '#..,#..' [--palette-fill '#..'] [--palette-line '#..'] \
     --reject painterly --reject photoreal [...] \
     --gate "<assertion 1>" --gate "<assertion 2>" [...] \
     --text-policy none|diegetic|furniture \
     --max-elements 5
   ```
   It copies every ref INTO `<pack>/refs/` (self-contained, §3a), writes `pack.json`, and fails loudly if a ref is missing, the count is out of 3-8, the anchor is not among the refs, or there is no gate.
3. **Sanity-read the manifest.** Confirm `anchor` is the content-neutral one and listed first; the gate reads like checkable pixel assertions ("ground is one flat X", "no text"), not vibes.
4. **Prove it round-trips.** Run `on-brand-image` once against the new pack with a simple scene; read back against the gate. If a defect slips the gate, the gate is too loose — tighten an assertion and note it.
5. **(Optional) Wire a universe to it.** If a universe should render its canon in this look, set `identity.register.stylePack: "<pack-id-or-relative-path>"` (SPEC §4.7 full mode) so canon renders and one-off images share ONE definition of the look. Registers that inline their anchor stay valid; this is additive.

## Where the pack lives

Standalone anywhere, OR inside a universe at `reference/style/<pack-id>/`. It resolves every ref within its own folder, so it is copyable. `on-brand-image` only ever needs the pack path.

## Definition of done

- `<pack>/pack.json` + `<pack>/refs/*` exist; every ref resolves inside the folder; the anchor is content-neutral and first; the gate has real read-back assertions.
- One `on-brand-image` round-trip passed its own gate.
- No caller re-types the style words: they pass the pack.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:create-style-pack

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
