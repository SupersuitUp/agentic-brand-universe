description: Stand up a brand-new story universe on the Agentic Brand Universe framework — a typed, git-versioned canon with a load-bearing pre-render gate, conforming to a named spec version. Interview the creator, scaffold via `abu init`, seed the first canon (entities/relations/first story), wire the gate, and hand back a universe that validates green and refuses to render until real references exist. Use when the operator says "start a new story universe", "spin up a universe for X", "/start-new-story-universe", "I want a canon/story world for Y", or is about to build the first book/property of a NEW world (not a new book in an existing one). One-time generation, not for ongoing canon edits.

# Start New Story Universe

Birth a new **universe** on the Agentic Brand Universe framework. A universe is the first-class
object: a typed, git-versioned canon (entities + relations), with stories as works
over it, references made load-bearing (their absence is a crash, not a drift), and quality
wired as gates rather than remembered. This skill does the one-time generation; ongoing
work is normal canon commits plus a renderer skill (e.g. `create-brand-os-picture-book`).

> **What this is NOT:** a new *book* inside an existing universe. If the world already
> exists (e.g. Nation of Fire), do not scaffold a second universe — add to canon and use
> the book renderer. This skill is only for a genuinely NEW world with its own canon repo.

## Running `abu`

`abu <verb>` below is the engine CLI. When `abu` is not on PATH (a plugin install puts none there), run the same verb through the plugin's own entrypoint, from the directory you are already in:

    ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}
    node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" <verb> ...

With no `node`, the engine runs directly: `PYTHONPATH="${ABU%/}/engine" python3 -m agenticstory.cli <verb> ...`. Never `cd` into `engine/` to run it: a relative universe path then resolves inside the plugin.

## Canonical source (read before executing)

The framework spec is the source of truth for every field contract and invariant. Read it,
do not re-derive it:

- **Spec:** `agenticstory/SPEC.md` (the repo this skill lives in) — canonical home `https://agenticbranduniverse.com`.
- **Engine:** `agenticstory/engine/` — the scaffolder + validator + gate. Run its CLI; do
  not hand-write universe files the engine can generate and check.

Every universe this skill creates records, in its `universe.json` `spec` block, exactly
which spec **version** it conforms to and the wiki that defines it — provenance, like a
`BOOMERANG.md` `conforms_to`. Never scaffold a universe that does not name its spec version.

## The six bets you are honoring (from SPEC §2)

1. **Universe-first** — the evolving canon is primary; a work is a projection that writes back.
2. **Canon is medium-neutral** — entities carry no medium; a renderer is a separate, pluggable layer.
3. **References are load-bearing** — every asset resolves to a real file or the build fails loudly.
4. **Quality = taste × craft × truth** — human taste gates, encoded craft-canon, and per-beat provenance.
5. **Evolution is version control** — every canon change is a commit; contradictions are diffs.
6. **Agent-writable by construction** — everything is validated structured data or prose in a known slot.

## The recipe

### Phase 0 — Route & confirm scope
Confirm this is a NEW world, not a new property in an old one. If the operator names an
existing universe, stop and redirect to that universe's canon + renderer. Pick the canon
repo home (default: a new top-level repo `<universe>/` beside your other repos (ask where they keep projects; never assume) with a
`universe/` canon dir inside, mirroring `nation-of-fire/nof-universe`). One repo per universe
(SPEC §8) — do not add to a shared multi-universe store.

### Phase 1 — Interview (one question at a time)
Gather only what canon needs to begin. Do not over-ask; the universe grows by making stories.
- **Name** (slug) and one-line premise of the world.
- **Asset root** — leave it `.` (the default). Every asset lives INSIDE this universe repo
  (SPEC §3a self-containment). Do NOT set it to `..` to reach sibling property repos — that is
  the scatter the framework exists to kill (the Nation of Fire canon started that way and had to
  be consolidated back in). A universe you can clone as one folder, whose refs all resolve, is the
  guarantee. Properties keep their own spread art / narration; the universe owns the canonical
  refs (character sheets, setting plates, reference photos) under its own root.
- **Identity** — the constants this universe is known by, written into `universe.json` `identity`
  (SPEC §11): its `mark` (the "made in this universe" byline), a `platformUniverseId` if it will
  ship to a shared platform, a `theme` (brand token set), a `closingOrnament` if it has a recurring
  closing motif, and `voice` term rules (words to capitalize / keep one-word for the voice gate).
  These are DATA the generic framework skills read — never hardcode them into a skill.
  Also set `identity.register`: the universe's illustrative **style** (default **"detailed comic
  book"**), which the renderer passes as a style anchor on every render. Note any `rejectedPoles`
  (styles to bake as negatives, e.g. photoreal, anime, washed-out).
- **The first property** — its working title, its **spine** (the arc invariant it must
  satisfy: `obedient-servant | thesis | primer | testimony | …`; NOT assumed to be a
  hero-journey — SPEC finding 1), and whether it is carried by a character, a **setting**,
  or a **visual-metaphor** (finding 2).
- **Any real people** as subjects — if yes, each becomes a `character` with a `realPerson`
  dossier (photo stack, approval gate, sensitive list — finding 4) and the property stays
  gated until the subject blesses it.

### Phase 2 — Scaffold (tested machinery, not hand-authoring)
From the engine dir (`agenticstory/engine`):
```bash
python3 -m agenticstory.cli init <repo>/<slug>-universe --name <slug> [--example]
```
- Use `--example` for the operator's first-ever universe (drops a worked
  character/setting/story/relation so the shape is obvious); omit it once they know the shape.
- This writes `universe.json` (with spec provenance + a stub `identity` block + the
  self-containment note), `canon/{entities,relations}/`, `stories/`, a `canon/README.md`, and the
  load-bearing gate `canon/scripts/assert.sh`. Name the repo folder `<slug>-universe` (not the
  generic `universe`), so it stands on its own.
- **Fill the `identity` block** with the values gathered in Phase 1 (mark, theme, voice terms,
  etc.). Leave `assetRoot` at `.`.
- **Style-lock (register anchor).** The scaffold sets `register.name` (default "detailed comic
  book") with `register.anchor: null`. Lock the anchor before rendering: generate a content-neutral
  style swatch in that named style (no universe characters, just palette + line + finish), get the
  operator's "that's the look" approval, save it to `reference/register/style-anchor.png`, and set
  `identity.register.anchor` to that path. Until locked, renderers warn and fall back to wording.
- Do NOT scaffold or fork any per-universe skill. The operations (ref resolution, casting sweep,
  entity register, render read-back, voice gate, the renderer) are **framework skills** the
  universe inherits, parameterized by this universe's path + `identity` (SPEC §11). A universe
  ships data, not skill code.
- The command prints a `validate → OK`. If it is not OK, stop and fix before seeding canon.

### Phase 3 — Seed the first canon
Translate the interview into typed records (SPEC §4 is the field contract; copy the shapes,
do not invent fields). Minimum viable first canon:
- **Entities:** the first property's protagonist(s)/setting/visual-metaphor. A renderer-consumed
  entity needs `structured.sheets` + `requiredForRender`; a setting/visual-metaphor needs a
  `status` + `contract` and stays **unlocked** (correctly refused) until its turnaround +
  empty plates + blueprint + map/blocking/dressing exist.
  A renderer-consumed entity is complete when its **reference matrix** (SPEC §12) is locked: for a
  character, the ~8-shot set (face-neutral/3q/expressions, forward-fullbody, profile L+R, back,
  signature-pose); for a setting, its contract plates; for a visual-metaphor, its states. Use
  `abu lock-level <universe> <entity>` to see stub/partial/locked. Authoring a new entity
  is the job of the `add-*` framework skills (they scaffold the matrix slots + prompts).
- **Relations:** any known `appears-in` / `crossover-with` / `derived-from` edges.
- **First story:** one `stories/<id>.json`. Register it as `status: "stub"` (spine + logline
  only) if beats are not written yet; promote to `"full"` (features + beats + per-beat
  provenance + register) when it is real.
- Run `validate` after each addition; keep it green.

### Phase 4 — Wire quality gates (surface, don't automate away)
The gates are load-bearing on purpose (SPEC §3.5). Establish, for this universe:
- **Taste gates** — the human "that's it / that's not it" moments the renderer must stop at
  (words-before-art, register lock, face lock, subject approval). Name them; do not skip them.
- **Craft-canon** — the world's enforceable invariants (its spine shapes, its refrain rule,
  "awe not horror", palette laws). Encode discovered rules as they are earned — craft is
  discovered then encoded (SPEC §5), never assumed up front.
- **Provenance** — every full-story beat cites a real source. Unsourced vivid detail is a flag.

### Phase 5 — Version, verify, hand off
- `git init` in the new repo; first commit is the scaffold + first canon (the diff is the
  changelog; every later canon mutation is a commit — SPEC §5).
- Verify: `validate` green; `assert-story <first-story>` behaves correctly (green if assets
  exist, or a clear refusal naming exactly what is missing — that refusal is the feature).
- Hand off: the renderer (`create-brand-os-picture-book` / a universe-specific layer) calls
  `canon/scripts/assert.sh spread|story …` before drawing any unit. No renderer may generate
  a unit whose assert has not passed.

## Definition of done
- A new one-repo universe exists, `git init`'d, first commit made.
- `universe.json` names the **spec version** and the canonical wiki (provenance present), and its
  **`identity` block is filled** (mark, theme, voice terms, etc. — SPEC §11).
- **Self-contained (SPEC §3a):** `assetRoot` is `.` and every referenced asset lives inside the
  repo. You could clone this folder alone and every ref would resolve. No ref points at a sibling
  folder or another repo.
- `identity.register` is set (default "detailed comic book") and its **style anchor is locked**
  (`reference/register/style-anchor.png` exists, `register.anchor` points at it).
- `validate` is GREEN; the first story is registered (stub or full).
- The load-bearing gate is wired and demonstrably refuses on a missing/unlocked reference.
- Real-subject properties are gated until blessed; no real person's private detail in canon.
- **No per-universe skill code was created** — the universe inherits framework skills and ships
  only data (canon, assets, identity, craft-canon).
- The scaffold does not bake in any single property's specifics — those live in that
  property's own surfaces, not in canon-wide files.

## When NOT to invoke
- A new book/property in an **existing** universe → add canon + run the renderer, not this.
- Ongoing canon edits → normal commits against the canon repo.
- A flat marketing site, a wiki, or a one-off illustration → wrong shape (see `start-new-wiki`
  for a wiki; the picture-book skills for a single book).

## Reference implementation
**Nation of Fire** (`nation-of-fire/nof-universe`) is the proof this works: ~24 properties, a
typed canon, the load-bearing gate, and a real dogfood (*Not Every Fire Is Holy*, whose
arena setting was correctly *refused* until locked). Use it as the worked example of a filled
universe — but never copy its property-specific rules into a fresh universe's canon.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:start-new-story-universe

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead. If `abu` is not on PATH, run it as `node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" report ...`, with `ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}`.
