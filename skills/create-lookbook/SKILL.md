name: create-lookbook
description: Scaffold a Lookbook (SPEC §4.7.1) — a portable folder (lookbook.json + refs/) that defines a curated but intentionally VARIED visual vocabulary (a wardrobe/fashion, a range of building silhouettes, a set of faces), the complement of a Style Pack. Use when a recurring aspect must stay on-aesthetic yet DIFFER per instance, and modeling it as a motif/prop (which force sameness) or a Style Pack (a render medium) is wrong. It writes 4-12 varied exemplars, a varietyRule (the "vary, never clone" instruction), and a read-back gate that checks for variety. Consumed by on-brand-image via --lookbook, and bound to a universe through a craft-canon register-rule that names it. Invoke via create-lookbook, "make a lookbook", "build a fashion/wardrobe aesthetic", or when you catch yourself wanting variety from a primitive that enforces sameness.

# Create Lookbook

The Style Pack answers "make more that look like this ONE look." The **Lookbook** answers "make more that belong to this FAMILY but each differ" — a wardrobe, a fashion, a range of homes, a crowd of faces. It is the primitive for curated **variety**, and it exists because the alternatives are wrong: a `motif`/`prop` locks a thing to render identically (the exact opposite of fashion), and a Style Pack is a rendering medium, not subject content. Improvising a folder of "clothing refs" with no manifest is the drift this skill kills.

## When to reach for a Lookbook vs its neighbors

- **One look, cloned every render** → Style Pack (`create-style-pack`).
- **One thing, identical every render** → `motif` / `prop` (`add-motif` / `add-prop`).
- **A family that must VARY per instance** → **Lookbook** (this).
- **The law that governs it** → a `craft-canon` register-rule that names the lookbook (e.g. rule `godly-aligned-dress` binds lookbook `christofuturist-fashion`).

## Inputs

- **4-12 VARIED exemplars.** Range is the whole point — a lookbook of near-identical images teaches uniformity, which is the failure it exists to prevent. Import blessed ones and/or generate a spread that deliberately spans body types, cultures, colors, silhouettes.
- **The aesthetic** — one line naming the vocabulary ("modest, dignified, individual, timeless-yet-modern Kingdom dress").
- **The varietyRule** — the instruction the renderer applies on EVERY use ("dress each person differently, drawn from this range; never a uniform, never two people matching").
- **Gate** — read-back assertions that check VARIETY in the output ("no two people dressed alike", "not a single palette across the crowd"). A lookbook with no variety gate silently drifts back to a uniform.

## Procedure

1. **Gather + bless the exemplars** (4-12, deliberately varied). Import + generate as needed.
2. **Scaffold:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.../skills/create-lookbook/scripts/scaffold.py \
     --dir <where>/reference/lookbook/<id> --id <id> --name "<Name>" \
     --ref <a.png> --ref <b.png> [...] \
     --aesthetic "<one line>" \
     --variety-rule "<the vary-never-clone instruction>" \
     --gate "<variety assertion 1>" --gate "<...>" [...] \
     --min-refs 3
   ```
   It copies every exemplar into `<lookbook>/refs/`, writes `lookbook.json`, and fails loudly on <4 or >12 refs or a missing gate.
3. **Bind it to the universe (optional but recommended):** add a `craft-canon` register-rule whose `rules` name this lookbook, so every renderer honors it (`dress per lookbook <id>`).
4. **Prove it varies.** Render one crowded scene with `on-brand-image --lookbook <path>`; read back against the variety gate. If the crowd is uniform, the varietyRule is too weak or the exemplars too similar — widen the range, tighten the rule.

## How it is consumed

`on-brand-image` (or any renderer) takes `--lookbook <path>`: it samples 2-4 of the lookbook's refs, prepends the `varietyRule` to the prompt, and adds the lookbook's `gate` assertions to the read-back. The lookbook rides ALONGSIDE the Style Pack (the pack sets the render medium; the lookbook sets the varied subject vocabulary).

## Definition of done

- `<lookbook>/lookbook.json` + `refs/*` exist; 4-12 exemplars resolve inside the folder; a real `varietyRule` and variety gate are set.
- One `on-brand-image --lookbook` render passed its variety gate (the crowd is not a uniform).
- A craft-canon register-rule (if the universe wants it enforced everywhere) names the lookbook.
- No caller hand-lists clothing refs: they pass the lookbook.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:create-lookbook

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
