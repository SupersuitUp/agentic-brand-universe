name: add-story
description: Add ONE story to an Agentic Brand Universe as a typed StorySpec (a medium-neutral work over canon, NOT an `add-entity` kind). Interview the logline, its declared spine (obedient-servant, thesis, primer, testimony, or another open-set value; a story is never assumed to be a hero-journey), its refrain, its register (defaults to the universe's `identity.register`, with a per-story override allowed), and its beats with per-beat provenance. Registers as `status: "stub"` (logline + spine only) or `"full"` (features + beats + provenance filled). Runs a casting sweep over the beats' named entities and hands off anything not yet in canon to add-character/add-setting/add-visual-metaphor/add-motif/add-prop. Art is NOT generated here. Use when composing a new property (book, chapter, or other unit) out of existing or new canon. Generic and universe-parameterized: pass the target universe.

# Add Story

One story, into a universe's canon, as a typed `StorySpec` written directly to `stories/<id>.json`. This is authoring, not art and not `add-entity` (a story is a work over canon, not a canon entity itself). It ends with a validated record; the picture-book renderer projects it into a medium later, and `shoot-references` still owns any new entity's art.

## Inputs
- The target universe (a path containing `universe.json`). Read its `identity` (mark, register, voice) and existing `canon/entities/` + `stories/`.
- The story's source material (a testimony, a design brief, a braindump) and whether it is ready to be fully beaten out or only worth registering as a placeholder.

## Procedure

1. **Interview with `AskUserQuestion`, never as a wall of prose.**

   **Do the reading FIRST.** Read the source material, sweep canon, and count the movements before asking anything. The tool is for handing the author a small number of real decisions with the work already done, not for making them fill in a form.

   **Batch the four recurring decisions into ONE call.** These come up on every story and each one changes the work materially:

   | Question | Why it must be asked |
   |---|---|
   | **Spine object / title** | Usually latent in the source's own words. Offer 2-3 candidates. |
   | **Beat-count target** | See the scale section below: a silently-invented number lands at drafting fatigue, not where the argument ends. |
   | **How much lives in the declared future** | 30 beats of problem and 1 of promise has hedged by proportion. |
   | **How far forward the future goes** | One life, one household, one town, or generations. |

   **`preview` is not optional on these.** Every one is a concrete artifact: put a candidate title beside the source quote it came from, and draw the beat budget as a movement-by-movement breakdown. A label makes the author imagine the option; a preview lets them see it.

   **Lead with a recommendation, first in the list, marked "(Recommended)".** You did the reading; give a real one, not a survey.

   **Do NOT ask what you can decide.** Register defaults to the universe's `identity.register`: state the default and move on. Same for anything findable in canon.

   What the answers must cover, however you get there:
   - **Logline.** One sentence: what this story is about.
   - **Spine.** The story's declared arc invariant, drawn from an open set (`obedient-servant`, `thesis`, `primer`, `testimony`, or a new value if none fits). Never assume hero-journey by default: an explainer is a `primer`, a property built around one object's argued states is a `thesis`. Ask which shape this actually is.
   - **Refrain.** The one line the whole property returns to or proves.
   - **Register.** Defaults to the universe's `identity.register` (same anchor + rejected poles as everything else). Ask only if this specific story needs an override (e.g. anchored to a real artist's own body of work) and if so capture it as this story's own `register` block.
   - **Features + beats.** Which canon entities this story selects, and the ordered beat sheet. For each beat: its text, its `location` (a setting/visual-metaphor id, if any), the `characters` it features, and its **provenance** (what real source this beat traces to: testimony, research, the author's own words). An unsourced vivid detail does not go in a beat.
2. **Decide status.** `"stub"`: logline + spine only, no beats yet, when the roster should reflect a planned property before it is fully built (mirrors an `unlocked` setting). `"full"`: features + beats + provenance are filled in and required to validate.
3. **Casting sweep over the beats' named entities (reuse wins).** For every character, setting, visual-metaphor, motif, or prop named in `features` or a beat's `characters`/`location`, sweep `canon/entities/` + any CANON.md. Anything already there: reuse its id. Anything missing: hand off to the matching sibling skill (`add-character`, `add-setting`, `add-visual-metaphor`, `add-motif`, `add-prop`) BEFORE finalizing this story. A `full` story whose `features` names an unresolved id fails `validate`.
4. **Write `stories/<id>.json` directly** (no `add-entity`; this is a StorySpec, per SPEC §4.3):
   ```jsonc
   {
     "id": "<id>",
     "logline": "…",
     "spine": "…",
     "refrain": "…",
     "status": "stub" | "full",
     "register": { "id": null, "anchor": null, "anchoredToRealArt": null, "rejectedPoles": [] },
     "features": ["…"],
     "beats": [ { "n": 1, "text": "…", "location": null, "characters": ["…"], "provenance": "…" } ],
     "writesBack": [],
     "gates": { "wordsBlessed": null, "subjectApproval": null }
   }
   ```
5. **Validate + commit.** `abu validate <universe>` stays green: a `stub` story is exempt from the features/beats/provenance requirements; a `full` story must have non-empty `features` + `beats`, every beat's `provenance` non-empty, and every featured id known to canon. Commit `stories/<id>.json` + any entities the casting sweep created. Report the story's `status` and that rendering still requires `assert-story` (the deeper, asset-on-disk gate) to pass separately.

## Scale: how many beats is a story (READ THIS BEFORE WRITING BEATS)

**There is no default length, and inventing a small one silently is the most common authoring failure.** A beat sheet written without a declared target lands around fifteen to twenty beats because that is where drafting fatigue sits, not because the argument ended. Shipped books in these universes range from about thirteen beats to well over thirty, and the long ones are long because the material earned it.

**ASK THE AUTHOR FOR THE TARGET WITH `AskUserQuestion`, or state the one you are assuming and why.** Give each option a `preview` showing the movement-by-movement budget behind its number, so the author compares shapes rather than integers. Never just start writing and stop when you feel done. Anchor the number to the work the story has to do:

- **Count the movements first.** A thesis has to establish the sincere status quo, name the mechanism, prove it with a case, answer the obvious objection, and build the alternative. Five movements at four to six beats each is already twenty-five to thirty, before any scripture or inset.
- **Weigh the halves.** Add up the beats spent diagnosing versus the beats spent on the answer. If diagnosis outweighs the answer by more than about two to one, the story is an indictment wearing a thesis costume. Rebalance before rendering, not after.
- **A beat that only asserts needs a beat that shows.** Any claim about a character's gift, wound, or capacity that is stated and never depicted is a missing beat, not economical writing.
- **Scripture that carries argument is its own beat.** A verse doing load-bearing work gets a spread, not a clause inside another beat.

Cheap to add a beat now. Expensive after the art exists, because every later beat renumbers the whole render-spec, the manuscript, the platform manifest, the staged assets and the narration.

## The declared future gets REAL WEIGHT, not a coda

When a universe permits prophetic or expectant work (Nation of Fire's FAITHFUL PROPHETIC REALISTIC FICTION amendment is the reference case), **the future is the payload, not the epilogue.** The whole reason to declare a blessed future in faith is to let a reader stand inside it and look around.

**One closing beat that gestures at the future is not showing the future. It is hedging by proportion.** You can obey every word of an anti-hedging rule and still gut it by spending thirty beats on the problem and one on the promise.

So when a story declares a future:

- **Budget it like an act, not a line.** A quarter to a third of the beats is a normal share for the declared future in an expectant story, and more is fine when the future IS the subject.
- **Show it at several scales.** One life changed, one household, one town, then the multiplication across places and years. A single wide shot cannot do what a sequence does.
- **Render it in present tense, resolved, and inhabited.** People in it, doing ordinary things, unhurried. Not a symbol of a future, the future.
- **Do not caption it as hope.** If the universe abolished the hedge, the proportions have to obey the amendment too, not only the wording.

When in doubt, ask the author (via `AskUserQuestion`, with a `preview` sketching each option's future act) how far forward the story goes and how much of the book lives there. That is a story-shaping decision and it is theirs, not yours.

## The manuscript-to-story converter is DECLINED, deliberately

Every book so far has written a script that walks a blessed `manuscript.md`, pulls the
numbered beats into `beats[].text`, and carries a per-beat cast + provenance table the
manuscript does not encode. It looks like an obvious thing to promote, and `pave-the-path`
considered it on 2026-07-31 and declined it.

The mechanical half is about ten lines. The valuable half, the cast and the provenance, is
authored content that varies per book AND per source. Promoting it would mean **inventing a
manuscript-format contract** rather than paving a path anyone has walked: the framework does
not own the manuscript format today, and a converter would quietly make one up, so the next
book would be writing its manuscript to please a parser.

If a beat records `when` (a year or an index), put it in the story: `compose-spec` carries it
onto the spread and the era gate uses it. That much IS a contract.

## Gates honored
- **Reuse-first casting sweep** (step 3): never invent an entity a story's beats could cast from existing canon.
- **Provenance**: every beat in a `full` story cites a real source; unsourced vivid detail is flagged before it ships.
- **Spine not assumed**: every story declares its own arc invariant instead of inheriting a single hero-journey default.
- **No art here**: art generation is `shoot-references`; medium projection is the renderer. This skill only writes the story spec.

## Not this skill
- Creating a canon entity named in a beat → the matching sibling `add-*` skill.
- Generating or locking any entity's reference art → `shoot-references`.
- Rendering the story into a medium (a picture book, etc.) → the renderer.
- Recording a typed relationship between two ids (e.g. `appears-in` this story) → `add-relation`.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:add-story

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
