name: on-brand-image
description: Generate ONE on-brand image from a Style Pack (SPEC §4.7) — a portable folder of style references plus a read-back gate — with NO universe required. Compiles the prompt from the pack (style line + subject + the pack's rejected poles as negatives), generates with the pack's anchor reference passed FIRST, then reads the output back against the pack's gate assertions and re-rolls any defect from scratch. Use for the common case "here is a folder of images, make more that look like them": deck plates, page heroes, section art, icons, one-off brand illustration. Accepts locked canon entities via `--entity <universe>:<id>[@look]`, which resolves their sheets, alt-looks and invariants from canon automatically, passes them ahead of the pack anchor, and refuses the render if any required plate is missing, so a recurring element cannot silently drift. Generic and pack-parameterized: pass the target style pack.

# On-Brand Image

## When a render looks subtly wrong, suspect UNSTATED PHYSICS first

The commonest defect in a finished-looking image is not style, anatomy or
composition. It is a physical relationship the prompt never named, which the model
therefore resolved at random. Five in one session, every one invisible until a
human pointed at it:

- a phone filmed a selfie while its rear camera faced the subject
- a lifted floor hatch could not fit the hole it came out of
- burning letters reflected in still water the same way up as the originals
- a man stood *inside* the well he was standing beside
- a beam of light passed through a crowd and struck none of them

Each was fixed the same way: **state the relationship explicitly, say which way it
must read, and say what the wrong version looks like.** "The screen faces him, so
when we see his face we see the phone's BACK." "The panel and the opening are the
same rectangle, hinged on one long edge, so it would drop back in flush."

Two rules that follow:

1. **Before generating, list the physical relationships in the scene** — what faces
   what, what supports what, what reflects what, what the light passes through. Any
   you cannot state in one sentence is one the model is about to invent.
2. **A geometry rule belongs in canon, not in the prompt.** A constraint that lives
   only in prompt text is lost the moment the scene is re-shot for any other reason.
   The hatch rule was fixed once, then silently regressed when the same piece was
   re-shot with a character added, because nothing durable held it.

## A pack carries the LOOK; only `--ref-first` carries the OBJECT

A style pack influences a render, it does not reproduce anything. So when a specific
designed object has to appear in a scene, the pack alone reliably gives you a generic
version of that object in the right style: a locked pearl-and-gold eyeglass frame came back
as a plain clear frame three rolls running, because nothing was reproducing it.

Pass the locked plates as `--ref` **with `--ref-first`**, which puts them ahead of the pack
anchor so the object is reproduced rather than suggested. The rule: **pack for the look,
`--ref-first` for the object.**

Two things that still fail after you do that:

- **A reference fixes what the reference SHOWS.** An object plate is dominated by the
  object's front, so parts it shows only obliquely keep coming back wrong. The same frame
  whose front was finally correct still rendered wire temple arms, because the plate barely
  showed the arms. Describe those parts in words even though you passed the ref, and say
  what the wrong version looks like.
- **A material needs pixels to exist.** A finish, an iridescence, or a fine inlay disappears
  at portrait distance no matter how it is prompted. If the material is the point of the
  shot, frame closer; if the shot is a wide scene, accept that the material will read only
  as a hint and let the macro plate carry it.

**And `--ref-first` reproduces PROPORTIONS too, which makes it the wrong flag the moment one
dimension is supposed to depart from the reference.** Asking for a telescopic mast at three
times the reference's height, with the plate passed `--ref-first`, returned the reference's
own modest height six times running. The flag was doing exactly its job.

When a variant is meant to change a dimension, drop to plain `--ref` so the design carries
without the geometry, and then replace the lost precision two ways: **give the dimension a
ratio rather than an adjective** ("the neck is seven or eight times the height of the body it
rises from" beats "a tall neck"), and **put the scale anchor fully inside the frame**. A
person cropped at the shoulders cannot establish eye level; the same shot with their whole
body in frame fixed it in one roll.

## A scoped pack: say which use the render is for

A pack with a typed `scope` (SPEC §4.7, v0.62) renders only for the uses it lists, so pass
`--use <id>` with one of them. With no `--use`, or one the scope does not list, the render is
refused before anything is spent, and the refusal names the allowed uses. Never widen the scope
to get a render through: a new use is a decision, recorded first (who, when, their words) in the
pack's `scope` and, when the universe's register carries an exception for the pack, in that
exception too. The recipe records the use and the exception it rendered under.

## Canon entities: pass `--entity`, never hand-picked `--ref`

If a subject is a canon entity, name it and let the generator resolve it:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py --out piece.png --prompt "<subject>" \
  --style-pack <pack> --entity ~/universes/mine:jesus@spirit
```

That resolves the entity's required sheets (applying `altLooks`/`keepSheets`/`dropSheets`
and `supersedes`), puts them AHEAD of the pack anchor because a pack pulls hard toward its
own faces, bakes the live invariants and `prose.rules` into the prompt, records what it
resolved in the recipe, and hard-fails on a missing plate or an unknown look.

Hand-picking `--ref` for a canon entity is how you get a plausible picture of the wrong
person. Reserve `--ref` for inputs that are not canon entities.

**An entity with a reference implementation (SPEC §4.1.1) is reused, not repainted.** If
`structured.implementation` names a component or generator and the deliverable can carry
code or the generator's output, use that and do not call this skill for it at all. When a
painted image genuinely must depict it, `--entity` passes the captured original FIRST,
adds "matches its reference implementation" to the prompt and the recipe's entity
invariants, and refuses if the original is missing. Read the result back side by side with
that original; a reinterpretation is a DEFECT, however good it looks.

One image, in a known look, gated. This is the framework's **lightweight front door**: it consumes a
**Style Pack** (SPEC §4.7), not a universe, because "generate more images in this style" has no
recurring-identity requirement and therefore needs no canon.

Reach for the full canon flow (`add-*` + `shoot-references`) only when a *specific thing must render
identically everywhere*. If the subject changes every time and only the *look* is shared, you are in
the right skill.

## Inputs

- **The style pack** — a path to a folder containing `pack.json` + `refs/` (SPEC §4.7). Read its
  `anchor`, `refs`, `styleLine`, `palette`, `rejectedPoles`, `gate`, `maxElements`.
- **The scene** — what the image depicts, in one or two sentences. The ONLY free text in the prompt.
- **The output path**, and optionally a size (default square; pick landscape for page heroes).
- **Optional: locked masters** — paths to already-locked canon shots (e.g. a motif's `hero.png`) for
  any recurring element that appears in this image.

## Procedure

1. **Load the pack.** Resolve `anchor` and `refs` inside the pack folder. A ref that does not resolve
   is a hard error, not a warning: the look is the references, and a missing one silently degrades the
   render into generic AI illustration.
2. **Select references.** Always the `anchor` FIRST, then up to three more `refs`, choosing at least
   one whose motif matches the scene (hands, a figure, a diagram-ish arrangement). Append any locked
   masters AFTER the style refs. Never generate from prose alone.
3. **Compile the prompt** (do not free-write it):
   ```
   Create a NEW illustration in EXACTLY the visual style of the reference images.
   STRICT STYLE: <pack.styleLine>. <ground/fill/line rules from pack.palette>.
   Subject: <the scene>.
   <negatives: "no " + each of pack.rejectedPoles>.
   <the text clause for pack.textPolicy, from the table below>.
   ```
   Keep the element count at or under `pack.maxElements`; if the scene needs more, the scene is wrong
   for this look (split it, or it belongs on a diagram instead).

   **The text clause is chosen by `pack.textPolicy` (SPEC §4.7), never assumed:**

   | textPolicy | clause to emit |
   |---|---|
   | `none` | `ABSOLUTELY NO text, no letters, no numbers.` |
   | `diegetic` | `The only text is text that exists in the scene itself; render each of these EXACTLY: <declared strings>. No captions, no titles, no labels layered over the art.` |
   | `furniture` | `Render each of these strings EXACTLY, in this placement: <declared strings with placements>. No other text anywhere.` |

   A pack with no `textPolicy` reads as `diegetic`. Whatever the policy, **the caller
   declares the exact strings** and they enter the prompt verbatim, in caps if the look
   wants caps. Never invent a string the caller did not give you, and never render text
   the surrounding layout already supplies: a spread must not burn in the caption the
   page lays out beside it, and a page's H1 does not belong inside its own hero.
4. **Generate via the framework provider adapter** `scripts/generate.py` — NEVER the raw model script.
   It generates AND writes `<output>.recipe.json` (provider, prompt, specVersion, refs, sha256) in the
   same shape `shoot-references` freezes, so **every candidate is provenanced at birth**, not only at
   lock. Pass the selected references in order (anchor first) plus `--style-pack <pack-id>`. Provenance
   is a side effect of generating here; there is no un-provenanced image.
5. **Read back against the gate (mandatory).** Open the output and check EACH `pack.gate` assertion,
   AND each `guardGate` assertion the recipe carries (one per standing prompt guard that fired:
   a device's screen faces its user, a readable surface faces its reader, and so on; see
   `render-readback` step 2a),
   against the actual pixels, returning PASS or DEFECT per item. This is the load-bearing half; a pack
   without a gate is a mood board.
   **If the pack permits text, spelling is part of the read-back, not an afterthought.** Read every
   glyph in the image and compare it character by character to the declared strings. A near-miss
   ("PROVENENCE") is a DEFECT, not a pass. Text the caller did not declare is also a DEFECT, because
   the model invented it.
6. **Re-roll defects from scratch.** On any DEFECT, regenerate the whole image with a clause added to
   counter that specific defect. Never stack an edit pass on a defective render. Cap at 3 rolls, then
   stop and report the surviving defects rather than shipping a silent failure.
7. **Report** the output path and the per-assertion verdict.

## Lookbooks (curated variety, SPEC §4.7.1)

A scene with a **crowd or a wardrobe** takes an optional **Lookbook** alongside the pack (`create-lookbook`). Where the pack sets the render medium, the lookbook sets a VARIED subject vocabulary (fashion, faces, home silhouettes). When given one:
- **Sample 2-4 of its refs** (not all; and not the same subset every render) and pass them AFTER the pack refs.
- **Prepend its `varietyRule`** to the prompt ("dress each person differently from this range; never a uniform, never two people matching").
- **Add its `gate` assertions** to the read-back, and re-roll from scratch if the crowd comes back uniform.
- Pass `--lookbook <path>` to the provider adapter so the recipe records it.
A universe binds a lookbook everywhere via a `craft-canon` register-rule that names it (e.g. `godly-aligned-dress` → `christofuturist-fashion`), so uniformity can never silently creep back in.

## Rendering operations (hard-won)

- **A render is NOT reproducible.** The OpenAI image models (gpt-image-2.5 included) have no seed parameter; nano's `seed` is not pixel-deterministic. So **never delete an un-locked candidate** — once a good roll is gone it cannot be regenerated. Stage candidates, prune only AFTER the winner is locked. (A blessed yoke roll was lost exactly this way.)
- **Batch renders in the background.** A high-tier render is minutes per image (measured ~2 minutes on gpt-image-2 at `--quality high`; not re-measured on 2.5); a foreground call under a 2-minute cap, or several in parallel, gets killed mid-generation with nothing saved. Run multi-image batches detached and collect them when they finish.
- **Renders that HANG with no error are a stale SDK, not a slow API. Check the resolved client
  version FIRST.** `generate_image.py` pins `openai>=2.48` for exactly this reason. When its
  PEP-723 header said only `openai`, uv happily reused a months-old cached environment on openai
  2.32.0, and that version hangs on a multi-image `images.edit`: the request goes out, `lsof` shows
  an ESTABLISHED socket, and the process sits at 0% CPU until the timeout fires, burns a retry, and
  does it again. Same script, same refs, same prompt: stale env hung 14 minutes, `uv run --refresh`
  finished in 58s.
  The trap is that it presents as a slow or throttled API, so the instinct is to raise `--timeout`,
  which makes it strictly worse. Diagnose by elimination instead, cheapest first: `curl /v1/models`
  (auth + network), `curl /v1/images/edits` with the same refs (the endpoint itself), then `lsof -p`
  on the hung PID (an ESTABLISHED socket at 0% CPU means the client is wedged, not the server). If
  `--refresh` fixes it, raise the floor in the script rather than living on `--refresh`.
- **References are style carriers, not masters — `generate.py` downscales them for upload
  (`--ref-max-edge`, default 1024).** A pack whose refs are full-size 1536x1024 PNG spreads ships
  ~14MB *per request*; downscaling to 1024px and encoding non-alpha refs as JPEG cuts that to 1.2MB
  (13x). This is a throughput and cost fix, **not** a fix for hangs (see the SDK note above). Alpha is
  preserved as PNG, because a cut-out mark flattened onto white teaches the model a box. The recipe
  still records the ORIGINAL ref paths, so provenance is unaffected.
- **Concurrency of 6 is too many; 3 is the working number.** Parallel requests queue server-side and
  can time out together, and a timeout means no image AND no recipe.
- **A logo/mark destined for a transparent cutout must be rendered on a GREEN SCREEN, not a "nice" ground.** Prompt it FLOATING on a flat chroma-key green (`#00B140`) with NO shadow, NO reflection, NO surface — then key it (`greenness = G - max(R,B) > threshold`, border-connected flood so interior highlights survive, + green despill). A warm/bone background bakes a floor reflection or contact-shadow that reads as high-chroma gold and defeats every heuristic cutout (a whole cutout was lost fighting one). Green makes the key trivial and artifact-free. The keyer is `scripts/chroma_key.py`; do not hand-roll the key.
- **A DARK-ON-DARK silhouette cutout needs `--choke 12` on the keyer.** Despill turns green edge contamination into a bright yellow hairline exactly where the subject is near-black; `chroma_key.py --choke N` floods each semi-alpha edge pixel with the color of the nearest fully-opaque body pixel (alpha untouched; unreached thin detail is kept, green-dominance clamped), and prints the remaining green-dominant pixel count for the read-back. Promoted 2026-08-03 after being hand-rolled three times in the electric-hymnal diorama works.
- **Verify a rendered mark's geometry against its spec; the model exaggerates.** An image model reliably over-stretches a deliberate proportion (a North Star Cross with a 1.48x-longer bottom rendered at ~1.7x). Measure the actual arm ratios in the output (isolate the shape by chroma, find the tip extents) and, since a render is not reproducible, DETERMINISTICALLY correct it (e.g. scale only the region past the crossing to hit the exact ratio) rather than re-rolling and hoping.

## Gates honored

- **References-first** — the look is carried by the reference images, never by wording it harder. A
  prompt-only attempt at a locked style reliably produces generic AI illustration.
- **Read-back (SPEC §3.5)** — every render is verified against the pack's gate before it is accepted.
- **Text is GATED, not banned (v0.12)** — the old rule here was a blanket prohibition, and it was the
  wrong shape. It conflated three things and quietly degraded artifacts whose whole job is to explain:
  a book cover in frame could not say what it says, and a wiki hero could not carry the title bar and
  captions that make it readable. `pack.textPolicy` decides what is allowed; the read-back decides
  whether it is correct. **Every declared string is verified character-exact against the pixels, and a
  misspelling or a dropped glyph is a DEFECT that re-rolls the whole image.** Models do still misspell,
  which is an argument for checking rather than for forbidding. This is the same posture the framework
  already takes on a cover title. The one prohibition that survives every policy: never render text the
  surrounding layout already supplies.
- **Anatomy is a gate concern, not a prompt concern.** You cannot reliably prompt away a bad hand.
  Either the look is deliberately non-anatomical (loopy ink hands have no finger-count to get wrong,
  which is why this style sidesteps the defect by construction), or the gate catches it and re-rolls.
  When a hand IS anatomical enough to count, state the digit budget explicitly ("exactly four fingers
  plus one thumb") AND count it in the read-back; the prompt alone will not hold.
- **A set must be uniform in kind.** When the scene contains several of the same element, give every
  one of them the defining feature. Varying a set by OMISSION reads as failure, not as variety: three
  winged towers where one lacks wings does not say "these are different companies", it says "that one
  is broken". Vary size, height, spacing, or angle instead, and never the thing that defines the set.

## Not this skill

- A recurring element that must be identical across many images → `add-motif` / `add-prop` /
  `add-character`, then `shoot-references`. Pass the resulting locked master back into THIS skill as an
  extra input.
- A full book spread with characters, poses, and a setting → `compose-spread`.
- Standing up a new look from scratch, or a universe → `start-new-story-universe`.
- An explanatory diagram carrying labels and text → not an image-model job at all; author it as SVG.

## MULTI-ENTITY RENDERS (two or more people in one frame)

`--entity` is repeatable. Every entity's locked plates, invariants and negatives merge, and
opposing invariants resolve correctly: if one entity's canon asserts a mark and another's
forbids it, the render carries that asymmetry without either being named in the prompt.

Three requirements that are not obvious, each earned by a wrong render:

1. **State "EXACTLY ONE of each person in frame, never duplicated."** Otherwise a face gets
   duplicated into the background.
2. **Name each person's ethnicity in the scene line** when they differ, or one drifts toward
   the other across a batch.
3. **Never dress a couple in a matching set.** Same palette family, same formality, cut for
   each separately. Matching reads as costume; a shared register reads as one household.
   "Related" means several shades apart in value AND saturation, not the same hue.

Landscape (`--size 1536x1024`) suits two figures; portrait suits one.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:on-brand-image

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
