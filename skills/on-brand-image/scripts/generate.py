generate.py — the framework's PROVIDER ADAPTER. The single generate path.

Every image in an Agentic Brand Universe/pack goes through here, and it CANNOT
produce an image without also writing its recipe. Provenance is not a separate
step you remember at lock time; it is a side effect of generating. This closes
the gap where candidate renders (everything before a lock) had no provenance.

On success it writes, beside the output, `<output>.recipe.json`:
  { provider, model, size, quality, prompt, specVersion, stylePack?,
    refs:[{path}], timestamp, sha256 }
This is the SAME recipe shape `shoot-references` freezes and `compose-spread` emits, so
a generated candidate is already lock-ready and `lint-universe`-auditable.

Skills (on-brand-image, shoot-references, compose-spread) call THIS, never the raw model
script. Providers today: gpt-image-2 (chatgpt-images), nano-banana-pro.

Usage:
  python3 generate.py --out <path.png> --prompt "..." [--prompt-file f] \\
    --ref <a.png> [--ref ...] [--model gpt-image-2|nano-banana-pro] \\
    [--size 1536x1024] [--quality high] [--spec-version 0.6] [--style-pack <id-or-path>] \\
