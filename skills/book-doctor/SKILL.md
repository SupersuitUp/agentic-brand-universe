description: Grade a RENDERED book on local disk against what its render-spec declares, BEFORE it is delivered anywhere. Checks that every declared spread exists, that the endcaps (front cover and closing plate) are portrait while interiors are landscape, that every generated asset carries its provenance recipe, that no spread was generated from another spread render, and optionally that every cast entity is registered and locked. Deliberately knows nothing about any delivery surface: no bucket, no CDN, no reader URL, no network, no API key. Use when Gary says "book doctor", "is this book done", "check the book", "grade this book", "/book-doctor", or before declaring ANY rendered book finished. Complements assert-story (pre-render gate, no output yet to measure), lint-universe (static warnings) and universe-doctor (grades the whole universe); a delivery platform's own doctor probing its storage is a separate, platform-owned tool and the two do not overlap.

# Book Doctor

The Doctor Pattern applied to one rendered property: a fixed rubric, a punch-list, and an exit code. Run it before you call a book finished.

`assert-story` gates BEFORE a render, when there is no output to measure. `book-doctor` grades AFTER, when there is.

## What it checks

| # | Check | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Every spread declared in `render-spec.json` has a rendered file | A book can look done because the spreads you looked at exist. |
| 2 | Interiors are at the spec's `size` aspect | A stray portrait interior gets letterboxed. |
| 3 | **Front cover AND closing plate are PORTRAIT (3:4)** | Both are ENDCAPS, composed by the reader as single pages. The closing plate living at `spread-<N+1>` describes where it lives, not what shape it is; building it like an interior gets it cropped. |
| 4 | Every rendered asset has a `recipe.json` beside it | Provenance is a non-negotiable (model, exact prompt, every input by path) and recipes are build artifacts that never ship, so this is the only place it is checkable. |
| 5 | No asset was generated from another spread render | Editing a prior render lets a defect survive into its own "fix". The evidence is the recipe's input list, which also never ships. |
| 6 | (with `--universe`) every cast entity is registered and locked | A spread naming an unlocked or unregistered entity renders a stranger. |

## Usage

```bash
python3 $ABU/skills/book-doctor/scripts/book_doctor.py \
  <book-dir> [--universe <universe-path>] [--json]
```

`<book-dir>` holds `render-spec.json`, `spreads/` and `cover/`. Exit `0` healthy, `1` problems, `2` unreadable. `--json` for machine output.

Per-book overrides live in the spec under `"doctor": {"coverAspect": 0.75, "interiorAspect": 1.5}`; the defaults are the contract and you should need them rarely.

### An ENDCAP MAY BE DECLARED IN `spreads`, and it is not an interior

`compose-spec` emits the endcaps as ordinary members of the `spreads` array, with the ids
`cover` and `closing-plate`. Until 2026-07-31 the interior list was taken from `spreads`
verbatim, so a declared endcap was graded TWICE: once correctly as an endcap (portrait), then
again as an interior (landscape), and **the second grade can never pass.** The report read
`aspect 0.75 (want 1.5)` on a cover that was exactly right.

Two more defects compounded it. `max(int(id.rsplit("-")[-1]))` raised on the non-numeric id
`cover`, and the fallback counted the endcaps in, so a 69-spread book was told its closing
plate was `missing spread-72`. And check 6 read `characters`/`extras`, a dialect nothing in
the chain emits, while `compose_spec.py` writes and `assemble_prompt.py` reads `cast`, so the
cast-registered-and-locked check had been a silent no-op on every real book since it shipped.

The net effect was that **this tool failed every book, on both endcaps, while agreeing with
the platform's staging script about what the right answer was.** That is worse than having no
doctor: it teaches its operator that the doctor is wrong, so the run it finally catches
something real is the run nobody reads. Caught by the-power-of-obeying-book, 69 spreads, which
was correct and graded as three FAILs.

Accepted endcap names, in either naming convention:

| role | composer names (pre-conform, PORTRAIT enforced) | staged names (post-conform, exact 3:4) |
|---|---|---|
| front cover | `cover`, `cover-0` | `spread-00-cover` |
| closing plate | `closing-plate`, `plate-0`, or any id carrying `closing` as a word | `spread-<N+1>` |

The closing-plate names are matched by WORD, not by a fixed list, because a fixed list made the
two checks contradict each other: an id the list did not know (`plate-closing`) was demanded at
LANDSCAPE interior aspect by check 2 and at PORTRAIT endcap aspect by check 3, so no file could
satisfy both and the only escape was renaming the spec id. Earned on The Tithe Is a Test,
2026-08-02, which took the rename.

### The caption check reads the MANUSCRIPT when there is one (2026-08-02)

A beat's `text` is **instruction for the renderer** ("Theo sitting on the bench beside Jerry,
telling him about the baptism"); a spread's `_caption` is **the words the reader reads** ("It had
been a year since he stood at the back of the room"). In any universe that keeps
`stories/<id>.manuscript.md` those two are different documents on purpose, so comparing them
reported **29 of 29 verbatim-correct captions as stale** on a shipped book. A check that fails on
every spread of every book is worse than no check at all, for the same reason the endcap bug above
was: it teaches its operator to ignore the one run that finds something real.

So: the manuscript is the source when it exists, `beats[].text` when it does not. The defect the
check was built for survives, because **the manuscript is what gets rewritten** — on
will-there-be-ice-cream the words moved from an ice cream counter to a park bench and the caption
kept the old line. Three manuscript conventions parse (`**7.**`, `**Spread 7**:`, `### 7`), a
wholly-italic line is stage direction rather than caption, and comparison normalises whitespace,
emphasis and typographic punctuation. A caption that is a SUBSTRING of its beat passes, because
one beat set across two spreads is legitimate. When a caption matches a DIFFERENT beat, the report
says which, since that is an ordering mistake rather than a rewrite.

## The boundary (read this before extending it)

**This tool is local and delivery-agnostic on purpose.** A delivery platform that stores assets in a bucket has its own health check, coupled to that bucket's SDK, its registry, and its reader URLs, and sharing that platform's frozen-tested aspect helper is what makes it correct. Pulling that logic in here would fork a tested check into an untested copy, which is the exact bug those platforms tend to have already had once.

So the split is: **book-doctor answers "is this book finished and internally consistent," the platform's doctor answers "did it arrive."** Run both. Neither replaces the other, and checks 4 and 5 here are structurally impossible for a delivery probe because the evidence never leaves the machine.

## Gates honored

- **Provenance coverage**: an asset with no recipe is a defect, not a style choice.
- **No self-reference**: canon references only, never a prior render.
- **Endcaps are portrait**: the shape contract that pre-render gates cannot see.

## Not this skill

- Grading a whole universe's completeness → `universe-doctor`.
- Static pre-flight checks with no output yet → `lint-universe`.
- Refusing a render whose canon is not ready → `assert-story` / `assert-spread`.
- Confirming assets actually reached a delivery surface → that platform's own publish/doctor command.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:book-doctor

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead. If `abu` is not on PATH, run it as `node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" report ...`, with `ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}`.
