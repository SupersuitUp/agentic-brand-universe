description: Evolve the Agentic Brand Universe framework itself — its skills, engine, spec, templates, and plugin — instead of hand-rolling around its gaps. Invoke mid-session the moment you catch yourself (or Gary catches you) doing framework-shaped work by hand: a bespoke generate/provenance script, a manual step you keep repeating, a missing scaffolder (e.g. no create-style-pack), a look with no Style Pack, provenance saved by memory instead of by tool. The framework is young and WILL be missing things; hand-rolling once is fine, hand-rolling twice is a bug in the framework. This skill promotes the hand-rolled thing UP into the framework, bumps the version, ships it, logs it, and updates itself. Use when Gary says "why are we hand-rolling this", "update the framework/templates/skills", "fix the generator", "we know better", "/evolve-abu", or is visibly frustrated that a repeated manual action should be a tool.

# Evolve Agentic Brand Universe (the meta-skill)

The framework at `~/Documents/github-repos/agentic-brand-universe` is a **work in progress**. It is normal to hit a gap mid-build and hand-roll a step to keep moving. What is NOT normal is letting that hand-rolled thing calcify. This skill is the forcing function that turns "I wrote a one-off script / did a manual step" into "the framework now owns it, versioned and delivered, so no universe ever hand-rolls it again."

## The Promotion Rule (the "fix the generator" principle)

> When you catch yourself doing framework-shaped work by hand, STOP. Ask: *is this specific to this universe, or would every universe want it?* If every universe would want it, it is a framework gap — promote it. Do not ship the one-off.

Framework-shaped work = anything about **how** universes are built, not **what** a particular one contains: generating an image, saving provenance, scaffolding an entity/style-pack/universe, locking a golden, gating a render. Universe-shaped work = this universe's canon, assets, identity, craft-canon.

The tell you are hand-rolling a framework gap: you write a script or do a manual step, and renaming/deleting the universe would not change it. That belongs in a skill, the engine, or the spec — not in the universe repo.

Hand-rolling **once, consciously, to keep momentum** is fine — the framework is fresh. Hand-rolling the **same** thing a second time, or leaving the one-off in place, is the failure this skill exists to catch.

## When to invoke

- Gary is frustrated that a repeated manual action should be a tool ("why are we hand-rolling this", "update the templates/skills", "we know better", "fix the generator").
- You just wrote a bespoke script that duplicates or should live in the framework (e.g. a universe-local `gen.py` that re-implements `on-brand-image` + `shoot-references` provenance).
- A needed primitive does not exist yet (observed gaps: **no `create-style-pack` scaffolder** — `pack.json` + `refs/` is hand-made; a look with no Style Pack; provenance saved by memory rather than at lock).
- The framework's own update process changed (then this skill updates itself — see step 8).

## The repo and how a change ships (know this cold)

**There is ONE repo:** `~/Documents/github-repos/agentic-brand-universe` (public as
`SupersuitUp/agentic-brand-universe`). It holds `SPEC.md` (the contract, versioned vX.Y),
`engine/` (Python + tests), `skills/`, `providers/` (vendored generation scripts),
`registry/`, `SAVE-LOG.md` (changelog), and `run-tests.sh`.

**The repo IS the marketplace.** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` declares
`source: "."`, so the plugin payload is the repo itself, which is why the engine and
providers travel with an install instead of being reached for in someone's home
directory. There is no second repo to copy skills into and no sync step. Until
2026-07-30 there WAS one, a private marketplace holding a duplicate `plugins/abu/`,
and it was always the staler of the two; it is gone, and `sync-plugin.sh` is a retired
signpost.

**Shipping a change is four steps:** commit, push, bump `version` in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, then Gary runs `/plugin update`. The version bump is
load-bearing: an unchanged version makes `/plugin update` a silent no-op. Only Gary can
run it, so a change is not live until he does.

**Installing, for anyone:**

    /plugin marketplace add SupersuitUp/agentic-brand-universe
    /plugin install abu@agentic-brand-universe

## The evolution loop

0. **PROVE IT IS A GAP BEFORE PROMOTING ANYTHING.** Search the framework for what you are
   about to build:

   ```bash
   find skills -path '*/scripts/*' | xargs -n1 basename | sort -u
   grep -rl "<the-capability>" skills engine
   ```

   Hand-rolling is NOT proof the framework lacks the thing. It is equally often proof that
   the thing exists and was not found, and the fixes are opposite: a real gap wants a BUILD,
   a discovery failure wants a POINTER placed where the work happens. Promoting a duplicate
   is worse than the hand-roll, because two implementations drift and neither is canon.
   Earned 2026-08-01: a session hand-rolled a contact-sheet montage fifteen times with
   `contact_sheet.py` already in the repo.

   If it exists, do not build. Put a pointer in the file the operator READS DURING THE TASK
   (the relevant skill's method, a form's PROMPT.md, a repo CLAUDE.md) and stop. A catalog
   read at session start loses to an instruction read at the point of use.

   **Then search the `gap` label, the standing register of known-open gaps**
   (`gh issue list --label gap --search "<the capability>"`). It says whether
   this one has already been found, what the evidence was, which verb closes it, and why it
   is still open — so a second session neither re-discovers it from scratch nor lands a
   half-fix beside a planned one.

0b. **RECORD A GAP YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD TODAY.** Some gaps are real, proven, and still
   the wrong thing to land right now: an engine or SPEC change with sibling sessions
   mid-render, a refusal that would stop work in flight, a fix that wants doing once for a
   whole defect class rather than four times. Those go in a `gap` issue with their evidence
   and their next invocation, NOT into SAVE-LOG alone. This rule is paid for: the v0.32
   changelog records a gap that "had been FOUND AND FILED in this repo's own save log two
   days earlier and declined, and the next book paid for it by hand-negating an oil lamp and
   a clay jar in all 27 of its spreads." A chronological log is written once and read never.

1. **Name the gap in one line** (what was hand-rolled, why the framework should own it). If it is genuinely universe-specific, STOP — it does not belong here; keep it in the universe.
2. **Pick the level:**
   - *A skill is missing or wrong* → add/edit `agenticstory/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (+ `scripts/`). New skill: match the frontmatter shape (`name` + a dense `description` with trigger phrases), keep it universe-agnostic (takes a target universe/pack; hardcodes nothing).
   - *The engine is missing a capability* → `agenticstory/engine/agenticstory/` (+ a test in `engine/tests/`). Run `./run-tests.sh`; stay green.
   - *A contract/invariant changed* → `SPEC.md` (this is what forces a **spec** version bump and updates `conformsTo` strings).

   **WRITE THE SPEC TEXT IN THE SAME PASS, ALWAYS (Gary, 2026-08-01: "make sure
   /evolve-abu also makes sure to update the spec text").** Any change a universe
   author could OBSERVE — a new guard, a new refusal, a new field, a new selector,
   a changed default — must be described in `SPEC.md` before you commit, not
   "later". Not a changelog line: the actual section a reader would look in.
   State what it does, WHEN it fires or applies, and the defect that earned it, so
   the next person can tell whether it covers their case.

   This is a rule because it has already failed twice. `MOTION_GUARD` shipped
   2026-07-28 and 4.6 still read "four rules" months later, so the spec was
   describing a compiler that no longer existed. Two more guards landed the same
   way on 2026-08-01 and were only caught because a test now enforces it. The
   pattern is always the same: the code change is the interesting part, the spec
   text feels like paperwork, and the paperwork is the only thing a user of the
   framework can actually read.

   **PREFER GENERATING THE FACTUAL HALF OVER ASSERTING IT.** `docsfile.py` already
   projects derived facts into `README.md`, `docs/REFERENCE.md` and now `SPEC.md`
   between `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: name -->` fences, and `build-docs --check` runs
   inside `run-tests.sh`, so a stale block FAILS THE SUITE. SPEC 4.6's guard table
   is generated this way, read straight off the compiler's `*_GUARD` constants and
   their predicates.

   So when your change adds something ENUMERABLE (a guard, a verb, a provider, a
   form, a field), the first question is whether a block should project it rather
   than whether you should remember to type it. Gary, 2026-08-01, on being told
   the spec rule was prose: *"isn't the spec partially generated anyway?"* It is,
   and a generated list cannot drift while a remembered one always does.

   What stays hand-written is the JUDGEMENT: what the thing means, the defect that
   earned it, when to reach past it. Generate the list, write the reasoning.
   `GuardsDocumentedTest` covers the reasoning half for guards (each must also be
   described in prose, not merely appear in the table); extend that pattern rather
   than trusting the next author to remember.
   - *A new scaffolder/template is missing* (e.g. `create-style-pack`) → it is a skill; author it so it emits the same shape the consumers expect (read `on-brand-image`'s `pack.json` fields; read `shoot-references`'s `recipe.json`).
3. **Register the skill** in the plugin manifest `description` catalog (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) if you added one, so it is discoverable.

**If you are RENAMING anything (a skill, the namespace, a verb), two rules, both earned
the hard way during the `agenticstory` to `abu` rename:**

- **Sweep with `find -L`, never `rg` and never `Path.rglob`.** Both silently skip
  directories reached through a symlink, and Gary's skills are symlinked from
  `~/.agents/skills` into the repos that own them. `rg` reported 5 external references
  where `find -L | xargs grep` found 12, and a later Python `rglob` pass missed
  `make-a-nof-book` entirely, leaving a cartridge skill pointing at a namespace that
  no longer resolved. A rename verified by the wrong tool looks finished and is not.
- **Never rewrite a historical record.** `.recipe.json` files and dated canon
  attestations ("LOCKED 2026-07-26: generated via `agenticstory:shoot-references`")
  state what actually ran, under the name it had then. Rewriting them to the new name
  falsifies them, which is precisely what `backfill-provenance` exists to prevent.
  Change live INSTRUCTIONS; leave every ATTESTATION alone. In the rename that taught
  this, that split was 5 files to fix and 1,213 to leave.
4. **Bump the version(s):**
   - Plugin: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `version` — patch for a fix/new-skill, minor for a spec/contract change.
   - Spec: if `SPEC.md` changed the contract, bump its `vX.Y` and every `conformsTo`/`SPEC_VERSION` reference (engine `__init__`, init scaffolder). Universes conform to a spec version; do not break that silently.
5. **Test:** `./run-tests.sh` (engine green) if you touched the engine or spec-driven scaffolding.
   It also runs `build-docs --check`, so **adding a skill, a CLI verb, a form, a provider or a test
   makes the derived docs stale and the suite RED.** The fix is one command, not a prose edit:
   `(cd engine && python3 -m agenticstory.cli build-docs)`, then commit the result. Never hand-edit
   inside a `BEGIN GENERATED` fence in `README.md` or `docs/REFERENCE.md`; the generator owns those,
   and the sources are the SKILL.md frontmatter, the real argparse parser, `forms/`,
   `registry/providers.json` and `SPEC.md`. Hand-written docs that the generator does NOT own
   (`WELCOME.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, the narrative half of `README.md`) are yours to update by
   hand when behavior changes.
6. **Ship, and then PROVE IT LANDED.** Commit, push, bump `version` in
   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (patch for a fix or new skill, minor for a
   spec/contract change). Then run the check, naming the artifact you built:

   ```bash
   python3 skills/evolve-abu/scripts/check_delivery.py --expect <repo/relative/path/you/added>
   ```

   **Read its exit code, because it tells you WHOSE MOVE IT IS, and those two
   answers are not interchangeable:**

   - **exit 1 — yours.** Uncommitted, unpushed, or no remote. Nothing has left
     this machine. Fix it now; do not report success and do not tell Gary to run
     anything.
   - **exit 2 — Gary's.** Everything published; only he can run `/plugin update`.
     This is a real handoff, so say so plainly and say what stays stale until he does.
   - **exit 0 — delivered.**

   Shipping used to end at "tell Gary to run `/plugin update`", which is only the
   LAST of three links: `working tree -> commit -> push -> /plugin update`. When
   an earlier link is the broken one that instruction is worse than useless. It
   sends him to run a command that correctly does nothing, and its "already at
   the latest version" reads as confirmation.

   That is not hypothetical, and it is the reason this step exists. 1.6.0 shipped
   with `measure.py periodic`, three separate stewards then ran the script from
   repo paths because the plugin did not carry it, and the gap was filed as G40.
   The commit filing G40 then sat unpushed itself, along with 1.7.0 and
   `bless_ref.py`. Gary ran `/plugin update`, was told he was current, and was.
   **A version bump that never reaches the remote is indistinguishable from no
   work at all.**
7. **Log it:** append ONE LINE to `SAVE-LOG.md` — literally one line, no hard wrapping,
   under about 80 words. Shape: `- <date> v<version> — <what changed>. <the defect that
   earned it, with its number>.` Lead with the change, not the story; the reasoning belongs
   in the SPEC section and the commit message, both of which have room. No em dashes; Gary is
   sole author (no Claude co-author on framework content).

   **This is a real limit and it is routinely blown.** On 2026-08-21 four consecutive entries
   shipped at 74 to 172 words across 5 to 12 wrapped lines each, and Gary's note was "the
   version descriptions for abu are way too long." The pull is always the same: the defect
   feels worth explaining, and the changelog is the first place you reach. Resist it. A reader
   scanning SAVE-LOG wants to know WHICH version changed WHAT; anyone who needs why will open
   the commit.
8. **Update THIS skill** if the process itself changed (new repo in the chain, new version file, a new recurring gap worth naming). The meta-skill must always describe the current reality — a stale updater is the worst kind.

## Session-awareness (why this is callable mid-frustration)

When invoked because Gary is frustrated we are hand-rolling, first **take stock of the session**: list what was done by hand that is framework-shaped (bespoke scripts, manual provenance, missing scaffolders, a look with no pack). Separate reusable-everywhere from this-universe-only. Promote the reusable set through the loop above, in priority order (the thing blocking the current work first). Then return to the universe work using the now-real framework tools. The goal is to shrink the hand-rolled surface every session until it is zero.

## Definition of done

- The gap is a real framework artifact (skill/engine/spec/template), universe-agnostic, tested where applicable.
- **Every observable change is written into `SPEC.md` in the same commit as the code**, in the section a reader would look in, with what it does, when it applies, and the defect that earned it.
- Versions bumped; committed and pushed, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version bumped.
- **`check_delivery.py --expect <the thing you built>` was RUN, and its exit code
  reported.** Never claim a change shipped on the strength of a commit: exit 1
  means it is still sitting on this machine. Only exit 2 earns "over to you, Gary".
- `SAVE-LOG.md` has the entry; if the process changed, this skill was updated too.
- `./run-tests.sh` is green INCLUDING its `docs` line, so the generated reference describes the framework as it now is rather than as it was.
- The universe that triggered this no longer hand-rolls the thing — it calls the framework.
