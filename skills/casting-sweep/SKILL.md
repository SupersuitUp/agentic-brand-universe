name: casting-sweep
description: Before naming any NEW character, setting, or motif in a story, sweep the universe's canon for an existing entity that fits the role natively, and emit a casting table (each role: reuse an entity id, or NEW plus a one-line justification). Reuse wins by default: it saves the whole reference-matrix build and every reuse is a crossover receipt. Generic and universe-parameterized: pass the target universe.

# Casting Sweep

The reuse-first gate that runs before a manuscript names anyone. It stops the universe from growing redundant entities (two characters that are really one) and turns every reuse into a crossover. Run it during story brainstorming, before the draft commits to names.

## Inputs
- The target universe (a path with `universe.json`).
- The roles the draft needs (the protagonist, a mentor, a place, a recurring object).

## Procedure
1. **Sweep the canon.** Read `canon/entities/` (and any CANON.md) and index the existing entities by kind and role.
2. **Match each role.** For each role the draft needs, find the existing entity that fits it natively (same kind, compatible description, right era). Prefer reuse: a mentor role that an existing mentor entity can play is a reuse, not a new character.
3. **Emit the casting table.** One row per role: `role -> reused-entity-id`, OR `role -> NEW` with a one-sentence justification for why no existing entity fits. Reuse is the default; a NEW entity must earn its place against the swept canon.
4. **Hand off the NEWs.** For each NEW row, hand off to the matching authoring skill (`add-character`, `add-setting`, `add-visual-metaphor`, `add-motif`, `add-prop`).

## Gates honored
- **Reuse-first:** never invent an entity an existing one already covers. Every reuse is a crossover receipt.


## Archived canon is NOT a reuse candidate (SPEC v0.16)

Reuse-first has an obvious failure mode once a universe is old enough to retire things: the sweep is
looking for an entity that fits the role, and a RETIRED one fits as well as it ever did. Reusing it
is not a crossover receipt, it is a regression.

Skip any entity whose `lifecycle` is `archived`. If it declares `archived.supersededBy`, that id is
the candidate to evaluate instead, and it should be evaluated the same as any other reuse rather
than adopted blindly. Say in the casting table that the archived one was considered and why it was
skipped, so the decision is visible rather than silent:

```
counsel place | the-creek-path | REUSE (jerrys-porch is archived 2026-07-29, supersededBy)
```

`abu archived <universe>` lists everything retired, and the spread compiler refuses an
archived cast before spending, so a sweep that misses one is caught. Catching it here is cheaper.

## Not this skill
- Creating the NEW entities (that is the `add-*` skills).
- Writing the story (that is `add-story`).

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:casting-sweep

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
