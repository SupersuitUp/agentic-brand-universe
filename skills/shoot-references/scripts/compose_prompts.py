"""compose_prompts.py — write a NEW entity's prompts.md bodies FROM ITS OWN CANON.

THE HOLE THIS FILLS. `add-entity` scaffolds every shot body as `TODO(author)`, and
`chain_matrix.py` correctly REFUSES to shoot while any body still says that: a
prompt that lives only in a throwaway script is gone when the session ends, so the
art has no recorded intent and can never be reproduced. Both halves are right.

What was missing is the verb in between. `backfill_prompts.py` is the repair verb
for art that ALREADY EXISTS (it reads each plate's recipe), so it can do nothing
for an entity that has no art yet — which is every entity anyone ever adds. The
result is that every single new entity forces a human or an agent to hand-type
several near-identical multi-paragraph prompts, and each one is a fresh chance to
type an invariant slightly differently from the one the read-back will check
against. That is the actual failure: not the typing, the DIVERGENCE.

So this composes each body from the entity JSON itself:

    SHOT     <- the shot's framing (face plates get a head-and-shoulders framing)
    WHO      <- structured.render.always            (verbatim)
    POSE     <- structured.render.poses[<pose>].bake (verbatim)
    RULES    <- structured.invariants                (verbatim, one per line)

Nothing here is invented. A prompt composed this way CANNOT disagree with the
invariants the entity will be judged against, because it is the same strings.

Three rules it will not break, matching backfill_prompts.py:

  1. **It never overwrites an authored body.** A shot already present in
     prompts.md is left exactly as it is, whatever it says.
  2. **It never invents.** A pose that is not in the entity, or a sheet key that
     is not in structured.sheets, is an error and not a guess.
  3. **It writes the register line and the shot's target path** the way
     chain_matrix expects to read them, including the optional `(WxH)` size.

The framework RE-ADDS the register style line, the same-subject clause and the
negatives block on every shoot, so those are deliberately NOT written here; see
FRAMEWORK_OWNED in backfill_prompts.py for the matching list.

  python3 compose_prompts.py <universe> <entity-id> <shot>[=<pose>][:WxH] ...
  python3 compose_prompts.py <universe> <entity-id> --all      # every sheet key
  python3 compose_prompts.py <universe> <entity-id> ... --dry-run

`--all` maps each sheet key to the pose of the same name when one exists, which is
the convention every kind already follows, and falls back to the neutral framing.

Earned 2026-08-04 on nation-of-fire/learning-serpent-wisdom, where three new
entities (esther-hadassah, abraham-lincoln, and a youth era for daniel-of-babylon)
each needed this and it was hand-rolled in the book's scratchpad, which is exactly
the script that would have rotted.
