"""Generate an entity's reference matrix as a GOLDEN CHAIN. Kind-agnostic.

ONE meta-process for every entity kind (character, setting, visual-metaphor,
prop, motif), because the problem is identical in all of them: a reference matrix
is a set whose entire purpose is AGREEING WITH ITSELF, so its shots are not
independent jobs and must never be fanned out concurrently. Text alone cannot
hold a room or a face still; N shots generated in parallel from the same prose
come back as N different subjects that merely share a description.

An image model has no persistent geometry, so AN ACCEPTED IMAGE HAS TO SERVE AS
THE GEOMETRY:

    seed (hero shot, human-blessed)
      -> shot 2   conditioned on [seed]
      -> shot 3   conditioned on [seed, 2]
      -> shot 4   conditioned on [seed, 2, 3]
    the accumulated, mutually-consistent set IS the matrix.

Only ACCEPTED shots enter the conditioning set; a defect regenerates and does not
propagate, or drift compounds down the chain.

GOLDEN IS A HUMAN GATE. This script refuses to chain off a seed nobody blessed.
Bless it explicitly (after looking at it) with --bless-seed.

Usage:
  chain_matrix.py <universe> <entity-id> --print-plan
  chain_matrix.py <universe> <entity-id> --bless-seed <shot>

    `$` stops at the first line ending. A header authored across four lines therefore
    contributed ONLY its first line and the rest was dropped in silence.

    That is not cosmetic. On gary's first seed, 5 of 18 negatives reached the model and
    `a crucifix` was among the thirteen discarded, so the pendant rendered as a plain
    Latin crucifix, which the entity's own invariant forbids by name. A render was spent
    proving a parser bug. It is the same class as the header-implies-a-guarantee defects
    already fixed twice in this file: the file states a constraint, the author believes
    it is in force, and nothing carries it to the model.

    THE SECOND BUG, introduced by the first fix and caught one render later. Ending the
    block only at the next header or EOF means a BLANK LINE does not end it, so ordinary
    prose written underneath the list was parsed as negatives: one run sent 15 junk items
    to the model, including raw markdown fragments like the sentence describing this very
    parser. Making multi-line headers safe made trailing prose unsafe, and the fix for a
    silent-drop must not become a silent-absorb.

    So the block now ends at whichever comes first: the next `**bold header:**`, ANY `#`
    heading, a `>` blockquote, or a blank line that is not followed by another list item.
    That last clause is what lets an author write the list, leave a gap, and then explain
    themselves in prose without the explanation becoming canon.

    Items separate on commas OR newlines, and a leading list marker is stripped, so every
    shape an author might reasonably write is read identically. Anything that still looks
    like markdown rather than a constraint is dropped with a warning rather than sent: a
    negative the author never wrote is as wrong as one they wrote and never got.

    only the DEFAULT and each look is its own Style Pack under
    `reference/style/<id>/`: there, an entity whose story declares a different
    register would have its matrix shot in a medium it is never rendered in,
    and a sheet in the wrong medium is a weaker identity reference than one in
    the right medium. Hence the override.

    A DECLARED `identity.register.stylePack` IS NOT A DECORATION (added 2026-08-04).
    SPEC 4.7 full mode says a register MAY set `stylePack` to source its `anchor` and
    `rejectedPoles` from a pack "instead of inlining them", and until now NO compiler
    read the field: `universe-doctor` scored whether it resolved and nothing else in
    the framework consumed it. So this resolver went straight to the inline anchor and
    a universe could declare a pack, score points for it, and never shoot against it.

    Two cases, and they are different questions:

      * **`stylePack` declared, no inline `anchor`.** The pack IS the register, exactly
        as 4.7 describes. Shoot against it. This branch changes no existing render
        anywhere, because such a universe previously hit the "anchor is null" refusal
        below and could not shoot at all.
      * **BOTH declared.** Genuinely ambiguous, and only the author knows the answer,
        so this REFUSES and names both. It is not a hypothetical: nation-of-fire
        declares `anchor: reference/the-readiness-lamp/hero.png` AND
        `stylePack: reference/style/nof-soft-painterly`, and its own `stylePackNote`
        says the pack exists BECAUSE the lamp anchor has a subject that comes back
        wholesale on a sparse render, naming two failures on 2026-08-04 where exactly
        that happened. A third followed the same day inside this resolver: the seed for
        `the-sealed-spring` was shot against the lamp and came back fully PHOTOREAL,
        which is that register's own top rejected pole. One paid image wasted, and a
        whole seven-shot matrix would have been if the seed had been blessed. The pack
        was found by hand and `--register nof-soft-painterly` fixed it on the first
        re-shot.

    Refusing rather than silently switching the default is deliberate. A shoot is paid
    generation, the two anchors produce genuinely different plates, and a universe's
    canon renders (compose-spread, cover) still read `identity.register.anchor` — so
    quietly changing what a shoot renders against would have made the reference matrix
    and the book disagree with nothing said out loud. One flag at plan time, before any
    spend, is the cheaper end of that trade.
