name: reroll-slot
description: Re-roll ONE already-rendered slot (a spread, cover, closing plate, or any asset with a .recipe.json beside it) as its recipe records — same prompt, same refs, and the recorded model unless that model is superseded, in which case the adapter's current one — with an optional one-line delta, in one command and one image call, reading ZERO canon. Resolves the recipe chain (including derive sidecars and the broken pre-v0.33 in-place-conform hole), regenerates through the provider adapter so provenance is written by construction, replays the recorded conform + publish steps for endcaps, backs up the previous roll, and ends with the render-readback reminder. Use when someone says "re-roll this image", "same but warmer/darker/at dusk", "regenerate the closing plate as-is", "run that render again", "identical but without X", or any art-only tweak to an existing rendered slot. NOT for edits that change text, cast, look, setting or register — those moved canon out from under the recipe, so use update-book / compose-spread, which re-resolve canon. Generic and recipe-parameterized: point it at any asset in any universe.

# Reroll Slot

The recipe beside every rendered asset is the complete reproduction context: model, full
prompt, every reference path, size, quality, and (for endcaps) the conform + publish steps
that followed. This skill is the verb that reads it back.

**Why it exists (the incident that earned it).** A trivial closing-plate edit on
*Nobody Labeled the Door* (hyperagentic-age, run `2026-08-07-1701-chat-a98f`) took **85
tool calls**, and the first render-adjacent call was #57: roughly 70% of the run was spent
re-reading the framework, SPEC and canon to reconstruct context that sat, complete, in
`closing-plate.png.recipe.json` the whole time. Recipes are written for reproducibility;
nothing consumed them. Orientation is only necessary when the answer is not already
written down.

## The one command

```bash
python3 skills/reroll-slot/scripts/reroll_from_recipe.py \
  <book>/closing-plate.png --note "identical, slightly warmer late-afternoon light"
```

- Point it at the **asset** (or its `.recipe.json`). It walks the chain itself:
  a `mode: "derive"` sidecar (platform copy, conform) is followed back to the
  generation; a chain broken by the pre-v0.33 in-place conform is recovered from
  `sourceRender` plus the closest-matching sibling `*-gen.recipe.json`, and the
  output says exactly which route it took.
- `--note` is the ONE intended delta, appended to the recorded prompt. Omit it for an
  identical re-roll. `--dry-run` prints the full resolved plan (prompt source, refs,
  replay steps) without spending anything.
- Generation goes through `on-brand-image/scripts/generate.py` (the provider adapter),
  never a raw model call, so the new roll carries its own recipe. Endcap chains replay
  `cover/scripts/conform_cover.py` with the recorded args, then the byte-identical
  platform publish with a derivative recipe. The previous roll is backed up to
  `candidates/pre-reroll-<ts>/` first.

## Which model a re-roll draws with

**The recorded model, unless it is superseded; then the adapter's current default.** The
superseded list and the current default both live in `engine/agenticstory/providers.py`
(`SUPERSEDED_MODELS`, `adapter_default_model()`), so nothing here names a model.

- A recipe saying `gpt-image-2` (or an older OpenAI image model, or no model at all) re-rolls
  on the adapter's default, today `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`. The plan prints the substitution
  and the new roll's recipe records `rerolledFrom.modelUpgradedFrom`. The OLD recipe is never
  edited: it is the record of what the previous roll claimed.
- A recipe naming a current model (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, `nano-banana-pro`) replays it.
- `--model <name>` forces any model, including a superseded one, for a like-for-like comparison.

Why not replay faithfully: none of these models takes a seed, so a re-roll is a new roll either
way, and the prompt plus refs are what carry the slot. And a recorded `gpt-image-2` is not
proof of what drew a slot: until 2026-09-16 compose-spread and shoot-references stamped that
name into the recipe of renders the adapter had drawn on 2.5, so replaying it sent re-rolls
back to the old model.

## When this is the WRONG verb

The recipe is a snapshot of a render, not of canon. If the edit changes **words, cast,
a look, a setting, or the register**, canon has moved and a faithful replay would
reproduce the stale truth. Those edits go through `update-book` (which honors the
words-before-art gate) and `compose-spread` (which re-resolves canon). The `--note` is
for deltas the render's own vocabulary absorbs: light, weather, mood, a small
compositional nudge, "no lettering this time".

## The gate still applies

A re-roll is a render. Read it back before accepting
(`render-readback/scripts/verify_render.py`, crop-zoom the invariants); any DEFECT
re-rolls from scratch — run the command again — never an edit pass on the defective roll.
The script prints this reminder itself so a headless run cannot forget it.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:reroll-slot

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
