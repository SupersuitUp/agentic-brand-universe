description: Put a BATCH OF WORKS in front of the operator for approval on their phone, one batch per page, and record what they decide about each. Large images, the title and the line saying what each work is for, and per work APPROVE or RE-ROLL with an optional note, typed or spoken. The default for ANY batch of finished works (wiki heroes, covers, share cards, flyers, a run of on-brand images): never hand-build a review page for a run again. Verdicts land in the same seen sidecars the shot board writes, every tap is announced on the Freedom bus, and every re-roll's note comes back as the exact `reroll-slot` command that applies it. Use when a batch of works is rendered and needs the operator's eye, or when someone says "let me approve these", "put them on my phone", "review the heroes", "which ones should I redo", "approval board". NOT for an entity's reference matrix before a lock (that is shoot-references' shot board).

# Approve works

A batch of works gets judged on ONE page per batch, from the phone, at a link that keeps
working across sittings. This is the shot board's sibling: same record, same refusals, a
different shape of input.

| Board | Input | Page | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| shot board (`shoot-references`) | one entity's reference folder | one-shot, cards | before `lock-shot` |
| **works board (this)** | a manifest of finished works | mounted, one batch per page | after a batch renders |

## Input: a manifest

A JSON list, or an object holding the list under `items`, `works`, `heroes`, `slots` or
`entries`. Per item:

| Field | Read from (first that exists) |
|---|---|
| image | `image`, `out`, `path`, `file` (relative to the manifest, or any folder above it) |
| title | `title`, `name`, `id` |
| context line | `context`, `argues`, `caption`, `description` |
| recipe | `recipe`, else `<image>.recipe.json` |
| batch | `batch` (optional) |

Batches follow the recorded `batch` when any item has one, else chunks of five in manifest
order (the size batches are rendered and composed in). A manifest written for a run already
works: `works/2026-09-25-supersuit-heroes/heroes.json` needed nothing added.

## Steps

**1. Open it.**

```bash
python3 skills/approve-works/scripts/works_board.py open <manifest> --id <slug> --title "<Title>"
```

It stamps every current candidate onto its batch's board, mounts the page in the Freedom frapp
store at `/abu-works/` (a stable URL; opening a second board costs no restart), and prints the
phone link. Re-running it is safe: a tap is never erased, and a work whose bytes changed (a
re-roll written to the same path) is put back on the board for a fresh look.

**2. Prove it serves, WITHOUT looking for them.** `curl -I` each image route: HEAD answers
without recording a serve. A GET, or a screenshot, records one, and then the record says the
operator saw a picture only you saw. If you screenshot a page, run `open ... --restamp`
afterwards, which forgets the serve on every UNJUDGED work (never a verdict).

**3. Text the phone link** through `freedom:message-myself`, without being asked.

**4. Hear the taps.** Each one is announced on the Freedom bus (`kind: judged`,
`source: abu-works-board`), so a session that ends its turn still learns of it. Read the state
with `works_board.py status <id>`; it exits 1 while anything is unjudged.

**5. A re-roll applies itself.** A RE-ROLL tap starts a DETACHED job (own session, nohup, a
`claude -p` run with bypass permissions reading a generated brief, logging to a file), so the
work re-rolls whether or not any session is watching: this session is restarted every time the
network drops, and every restart kills an in-session watcher (2026-09-25: a tap sat unread).
The job re-rolls that one work from its recipe with the note applied (`reroll-slot`), keeps
every rule the manifest and recipe carry, puts the new take back on the board, commits the
files it wrote, pushes, and texts the operator one line. Brief, log and report live in
`~/.freedom/frapps/abu-works-board/jobs/`; the job's state is in the sidecar under `rerollJob`,
so the card shows **Re-rolling now**, and a failed run says so on the card until a new take lands.

- **One job per work.** While one runs, a second tap on that card is refused (the page shows
  the refusal), so it can never start a second job. A lock whose process died is taken over.
- **Manual control:** `ABU_WORKS_AUTOREROLL=0` in the store's environment. Then
  `works_board.py rerolls <id>` prints, per re-roll, the note (typed, and the transcript of
  anything spoken, with the audio path) and the exact `reroll_from_recipe.py <image> --note "..."`
  command. Run those, read each result back (`render-readback`), then `open` the manifest again
  so the new rolls go back on the page.
- A CLI `tap` spawns nothing unless it passes `--spawn`; only the page does.

## What the page will not do

- **Show anything that is not a current candidate.** Nothing under `rejected/`,
  `superseded*/`, `candidates/`, `pre-reroll-*/`, and no earlier roll kept as `<slug>.rN.png`.
  The rule is `engine/agenticstory/candidates.py`, shared with the shot board; a manifest item
  pointing at one is listed as "not on the board" by name.
- **Take an approval for a picture it never served.** The engine refuses it (`seen.record_tap`)
  and the card shows the refusal instead of advancing.
- **Advance on a failed save.** The card stays with the error on it.

## Files

- `scripts/works_board.py` the verbs (`open`, `boards`, `batch`, `item`, `served`, `tap`,
  `status`, `rerolls`, `close`, and `job-done`, which only the detached job's wrapper calls). The page reads and writes only through it.
- `frapps/works-board.mjs` the page. Freedom's shell, recorder and notify bus, resolved from the
  newest installed Freedom at every start.
- `frapps/mount.mjs` puts the page in the store and prints its links.
- `frapps/superchoice.mjs` counts each verdict as one superchoice in Supersuit's counter (a works board is a
  review, counted per decision, never per card); an older Supersuit with no counter counts nothing.
- State: `~/.freedom/frapps/abu-works-board/` (`boards/`, waiting `takes/`, saved spoken
  `notes/`, cached phone `previews/`); `ABU_WORKS_BOARDS` overrides it. Verdicts live beside
  each image in `<image>.readback.json`, under `seen`.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:approve-works

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead. If `abu` is not on PATH, run it as `node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" report ...`, with `ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}`.
