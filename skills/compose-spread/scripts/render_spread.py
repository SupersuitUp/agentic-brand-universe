"""Render one spread, or a whole book: assemble each job from canon, then generate.

Thin wrapper over assemble_prompt.py (the deterministic, tested core) + the
chatgpt-images generate_image.py. The assemble step is pure software; only this
wrapper touches the model. Re-rolls are the caller's loop: render, run
render-readback, and on a DEFECT call again (the model is stochastic).

Usage:
  render_spread.py <universe> <render-spec.json> <spread-id> --out <path>
      [--skip-existing] [--quality high] [--print-prompt] [--dry-run]

  render_spread.py <universe> <render-spec.json> --all --out-dir spreads/ --jobs 4
  render_spread.py <universe> <render-spec.json> spread-01 spread-02 --out-dir spreads/

BATCH MODE (added 2026-07-31). This script took exactly one spread id, so EVERY
book grew its own parallel driver: a dozen lines of ThreadPoolExecutor over this
same subprocess, plus a skip-if-exists the script already implements. `pave-the-path`
flagged "the renderer's own batch mode" after she-had-everything-but-peace and it
was not built; the-power-of-obeying wrote the identical driver again. Two runs is
the bar, so it lives here now.

`--jobs` defaults to 1, so single-spread behaviour is unchanged: same stdout, same
exit codes. A per-spread failure never aborts the batch (the expensive spreads that
DID land must survive one that did not), and the batch exits nonzero if any spread
failed or refused.
