description: Make ONE work in a form a universe already declares — a flyer, a card, a poster, a scene, whatever forms/ holds. THE GENERIC FRONT DOOR: the form supplies the method, this supplies the door, so adding a new KIND of work means adding a folder rather than writing a new skill. Use when someone says "make a flyer", "make a card for X", "make one of those", "what can this universe make", or names any form. Also the correct destination whenever you are about to write a one-off skill for a new kind of artifact. NOT for picture books (abu:make-a-book owns that chain) and NOT for a single on-brand image with no form (abu:on-brand-image).

# Make a work

One work, in a form the universe already declares.

**The rule this skill exists to enforce: a new KIND of work is a FOLDER, not a skill.**
If making a flyer needs a `make-a-flyer` skill, and a card needs a `make-a-card` skill,
the framework has moved the hand-rolling up one level instead of removing it. Forms are
data. This is the one door.

## What a form is

A folder at `<universe>/forms/<id>/`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `FORM.md` | **required.** What the form is, its golden works, its status, its evals. |
| `PROMPT.md` | **required.** The method. **This IS the form's composer.** |
| `evals/` | optional. Scripts the method calls at the points it names. |

Both files are required. A folder without `PROMPT.md` is a note about a form, not a form:
nothing can be made from it.

> `forms/<id>/form.json` in the SPEC §4.8 slot encoding was RETIRED in v0.17. A folder
> holding only that is reported as retired, never offered as usable.

## Procedure

1. **Discover, do not guess.** With no form named, or when the operator asks what is
   possible:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/forms.py list <universe>
   ```

   Show the usable forms in plain language. Never invent a form that is not there, and
   never quietly pick one when several fit: ask.

2. **Resolve, and let it refuse.**

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/forms.py resolve <universe> <form-id>
   ```

   It exits on an unknown or unusable form. Do not work around that by reading the folder
   yourself; an unusable form means the method is missing, and improvising one is how a
   form silently becomes whatever the last agent felt like.

3. **Read `FORM.md` FIRST, and surface its status to the operator.** Most forms here are
   derived from one work. That is a hypothesis, not a standard, and an agent that reads
   only the method will follow it with unearned confidence. If the form says the next work
   is expected to correct it, say so out loud before starting.

4. **Read `PROMPT.md` and follow it exactly.** It is the composer. It owns the gates, the
   order, and the refusals. Where it names an eval, run that eval at that point — not at
   the end, not when convenient.

   If the method fumbles, or you find yourself working around it, that is a defect in the
   FORM, not in this work. Fix the form. This is `fix-the-generator` applied to forms.

4a. **A recurring element with a reference implementation is REUSED (SPEC §4.1.1).** Before
   drawing any motif, prop or visual-metaphor the work shows, read its
   `structured.implementation`. If code, a generator or a locked render already draws it,
   import or port that component, run that generator, or pass the locked render as a
   reference, and compare the result side by side with `compareAgainst` before calling the
   work done. Never rebuild it from its prose description: that is how continental-works'
   continent came back as flat squares beside the ribbon (2026-09-29).

5. **File the work where the universe says.** `universe.json` may declare `workRoot`;
   undeclared means the default, `works/<id>/`. The convention:

   ```
   works/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/
     work.json          id == the folder name, timestamp included
     <artifact>         blessed: a STABLE name, so consumers never break on a re-roll
     <artifact>.recipe.json
     candidates/        every attempt, timestamped, NEVER deleted
   ```

   A render is not reproducible, so an un-blessed candidate is the only record that
   attempt existed. Keep all of them.

6. **`status` starts at `candidate`.** Only the requester moves it to `blessed`. Looking
   at the thing is the gate, and you are not the one who gets to pass it.

## Adding a NEW kind of work

A new kind of work is still a FOLDER, and authoring that folder is now a skill's job:
**`abu:create-form`** owns the method. It scaffolds

```
<universe>/forms/<new-id>/
  FORM.md      what it is; its golden(s); a STATUS section stating the evidence base
  PROMPT.md    the method, step by step, with the gates named
  evals/       whatever the method calls
```

and its scaffolder REFUSES on zero evidence, because a form is written from works you
have ACTUALLY MADE, with `FORM.md` saying how many. A form written before anything
exists in it is the failure this framework spent a day removing: the retired composer
had 896 lines, 91 tests and zero works.

The division of labor: `create-form` produces the folder, this skill remains the one
door for MAKING works in it. Forms stay data either way.

## Gates honored

Words before art. The form's own gates, whatever they are. Candidates are never deleted.
Only the requester blesses. An unusable form refuses rather than improvising.

## Not this skill

- A picture book → `abu:make-a-book`, which owns that chain.
- One on-brand image with no form → `abu:on-brand-image`.
- Authoring a new form → `abu:create-form`. It produces the folder (above); this door
  is for making works in a form that already exists.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:make-a-work

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
