name: add-motif
description: Add ONE motif (a recurring visual element, gesture, or pattern that must render identically wherever it appears, not a one-off image) to an Agentic Brand Universe (interview what it is and its load-bearing detail, reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `motif` entity with SPEC §12's hero + detail reference slots and ready-to-run generation prompts). Art is NOT generated here (that is `shoot-references`). Use when a repeating visual pattern needs to stay consistent across many renders. Generic and universe-parameterized: pass the target universe.

# Add Motif

One recurring motif, into a universe's canon, as a typed record with its reference slots scaffolded. This is authoring, not art: it ends with a validated `stub` entity + ready-to-run prompts. `shoot-references` generates and locks the shots afterward.

## Inputs
- The target universe (a path containing `universe.json`). Read its `identity` (mark, register, voice) and `assetRoot`.
- What the motif is and where it recurs.

## Procedure

1. **Casting sweep first (reuse wins).** Before naming a new motif, sweep `canon/entities/` + any CANON.md for an existing motif that already covers this pattern. Only proceed if genuinely new.
2. **Interview (one question at a time).** Gather only what the reference matrix needs.
   - **DOES SOMETHING ALREADY DRAW IT? Ask this FIRST.** A site component, a generator, a locked render, a file on a live surface. If yes, that implementation IS the motif, and its prose will only ever be a lossy summary of it: record it as `structured.implementation` (SPEC §4.1.1: `kind` component | generator | asset, `path`, optional `repo` for a sibling repo, and for a component `compareAgainst`, a screenshot of the live original saved into the universe). Every later use then REUSES it and is compared against that original. If nothing draws it yet, write `{"kind": "none", "reason": "..."}` so the prose-only state is said out loud. Earned 2026-09-29: continental-works' continent motif lived only as a sentence, and a new surface drawn from the sentence came back as flat squares beside the ribbon.
   - **What it is.** The recurring element itself (a gesture, a light quality, a recurring symbol, a repeated compositional device) and why it needs to recur identically rather than be redrawn from scratch each time.
   - **Its load-bearing detail.** The one specific feature that, if it drifted, would break recognizability (the exact shape of a mark, the exact color of a glow, the exact framing of a gesture). This is what the `detail` crop locks down.
3. **Scaffold the entity (tested machinery).** From the engine dir:
   ```bash
   python3 -m agenticstory.cli add-entity <universe> motif <id> --name "<Name>" [--origin <first-story>]
   ```
   This writes `canon/entities/<id>.json` with `structured.sheets: {"hero": null, "detail": null}` and `requiredForRender: []`. It prints `lock_level: stub`.
4. **Fill the prose + invariants.** Edit `prose` (voice/lore/rules: when/how this motif is used) and `structured.invariants` (the load-bearing rules the read-back will check, e.g. the exact detail from step 2).
4a. **Record the implementation (SPEC §4.1.1)** from the first interview answer. With a real implementation, `hero` / `detail` shots are optional: shoot them only if a painted medium must depict the motif, and then from the captured original, never from the prose. `lint-universe` errors `IMPLEMENTATION-MISSING` on a pointer to nothing and warns `MOTIF-PROSE-ONLY` once a story or work uses a motif with neither a locked render nor an implementation.
5. **Write the generation prompts.** Create `reference/<id>/prompts.md`: a **hero** shot (the motif in its clearest, most representative form) and a **detail** crop (a tight close-up on the load-bearing feature). Each prompt: (a) passes `identity.register.anchor` FIRST and bakes `register.rejectedPoles` as negatives; (b) states the invariant that must never drift; (c) names the target output path `reference/<id>/<shot>.png`. These are what `shoot-references` will run.
6. **Validate + commit.** `abu validate <universe>` stays green. Commit the entity + reference dir + prompts.md. Report `lock_level: stub` and that the next step is `shoot-references <universe> <id>`.

## Gates honored
- **Reuse-first** (step 1): never invent a second motif an existing entity already covers.
- **No art here**: generation is `shoot-references`, so this skill never calls an image model.

## Not this skill
- Generating/locking the shots → `shoot-references`.
- A character, setting, visual-metaphor, prop, story, or relation → the sibling `add-*` skills. A physical object a character holds/uses (as opposed to a recurring pattern) is `add-prop`.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:add-motif

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
