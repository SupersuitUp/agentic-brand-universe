description: Record ONE brand PIECE (a reusable part of the brand with its exact recipe, or a pointer to the canon that already defines it - a selection state, a button, a thread of stripes, a section marker, a mark at a size) or ONE NO-GO (a thing the brand refuses, why, and the piece to use instead) into a universe's kit record (SPEC 13.1, craft-canon kind `kit`), with who decided it, when and in what words. Supersedes a contradicting canon line IN PLACE with the old words kept, and runs `abu check-kit` over the surfaces so a detectable no-go becomes a refusal instead of a remembered preference. Use the moment a human rules on a brand detail ("I don't like it when you...", "never do X", "use this instead", "that's the look for selected", "make that part of the ABU"), when you find a refusal scattered in rule prose or a STATE file, or when you are about to hand-write the same CSS recipe for a brand part a second time. Generic and universe-parameterized: pass the target universe.

# Add a piece or a no-go

A brand is small reusable parts plus the things it refuses. This skill puts ONE of either into the
universe's kit, where `validate` holds it to live canon and `abu check-kit` can enforce it. It never
writes site code: surfaces outside the universe are LISTED for whoever owns them.

## Inputs
- The target universe (a path containing `universe.json`). Run `abu kit <universe>` first: the
  piece may already exist, and a second id for one part is the drift this record exists to stop.
- The ruling, in the decider's own words, with the date. No verbatim means no ruling: ask, or cite
  the canon line it was lifted from as a `source` with its exact `quote`.
- For a no-go, the piece to use instead (record that piece first if it is new). If nothing replaces
  it, `instead: null` with an `insteadNote` saying so.

## Method

1. **Find the kit.** `abu list-craft <universe>` shows records of kind `kit`. None yet: create
   `canon/craft/brand-kit.json` with `id`, `kind: "kit"`, `name`, `summary`, `tokensFrom` (the
   `<file>#<path>` of the token map recipes name), and empty `pieces` / `noGos`. Shape: SPEC 13.1.
2. **A piece already defined in canon POINTS, never copies.** Give it `definedAt:
   "<file>#<dot.path>"` (numeric segments index lists). Only a new part gets a full `recipe`
   (tokens by name, sizes, CSS where it applies) and `usedIn`.
3. **A no-go names its replacement and its provenance.** `refuses`, `why`, `instead`, `decided`
   {by, on, verbatim}. Harvested from existing canon: add `source: [{at, quote}]`, quoting the line
   exactly; a sibling repo's file is `<repo>:<path>@<commit>` (recorded, not checked).
4. **If the ruling contradicts a live canon line, supersede it in place, never delete.** Rewrite
   the live line to point at the piece, keep the old words in a supersession note beside it with
   the date and verbatim, and add `supersedes: [{at: <live line>, said: <old words>}]` to the
   no-go. `validate` refuses the kit while the live line still says the old words.
5. **Give it a detector when the shape is mechanical.** `detect: [{pattern, files?, note}]`, a
   regex over source files, written with `[^}]*` so one match cannot span two CSS rules. Test it
   against the shape that actually shipped, and against the replacement so it does not fire there.
   A taste rule with no mechanical shape gets no detector; say so in the no-go.
   **A retired FILE is a mechanical shape**: a no-go whose `refuses` names a file (a mark, an icon,
   a generator script) detects on that file's name, and `validate` refuses it without one. The CW
   ribbon mark was retired as "a file rather than a source pattern" with no detector and shipped
   again in a new lockup.
6. **Gate.** `abu validate <universe>` (and the universe's own `assert.sh` if it has one) must be
   green. Then `abu check-kit <universe> <every surface repo it governs>`: hits inside the universe
   get fixed now; hits in repos you were not asked to edit are LISTED in your report, file:line,
   for their owners. Never edit them on the strength of this skill.
7. **Commit** the kit and any superseded canon file by explicit path.

## Refusals
- No item without `decided.by`, a `YYYY-MM-DD` date and the verbatim (or a quoted `source`).
- No second id for a part the kit already has; extend the existing piece.
- No silent deletion of a superseded rule; the old words stay, marked superseded.
- No editing a consumer repo from here; the report lists where the old rule still renders.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:add-piece-or-no-go

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
