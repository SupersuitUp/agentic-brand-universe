description: Scaffold and RE-SYNC a book's render-spec from its StorySpec, filling everything canon determines, enumerating every legal choice canon constrains, and never overwriting authored scene text. Use when starting a new book's render-spec, after adding or removing a beat, after shooting a new plate or wardrobe look, or whenever you catch yourself hand-writing a per-book authoring script. Trigger phrases: "scaffold the render-spec", "re-sync the spec", "compose-spec", "the spec is out of date with the story", "I added a beat".

# Compose Spec

A story already knows its beats, their locations, and who is in them. A render-spec restates
all of it by hand, so every book grows a bespoke authoring script, and **those scripts rot**:
the spec gets hand-edited afterwards, the script does not, and re-running it silently reverts
the edits. Earned 2026-07-30 in nation-of-fire, where the stale generator still carried an
identity-overriding `bake` and crowd prose that six hours of fixes had removed. Re-running it
would have undone the lot.

**This is not a spec generator.** It fills what canon DETERMINES, enumerates what canon merely
CONSTRAINS, and never touches what a human AUTHORED.

| class | fields | on re-run |
|---|---|---|
| derived | `id`, `setting`, cast membership, preamble, size | refreshed every run |
| chosen | `plate`, `pose`, `look`, `bake` | enumerated, carried forward, never chosen for you |
| authored | `scene`, `negatives`, flags | never modified without `--force` |

```bash
python3 scripts/compose_spec.py <universe> <story-id> --book <folder> --out render-spec.json
```

## Why the enumeration is the point

A `null` plate beside its legal values is **visible**. A missing wardrobe pose is invisible,
which is exactly how Selah went 20 spreads with her clothes unpinned. The scaffold prints
what still needs a human:

```
  spread-02: setting 'the-teaching-room' has no plate chosen
             (available: master, chairsCloseUp, fromTheChairs, fromTheChairsFull)
  spread-02: 'selah' has 7 poses and none selected (ql-shirt-trousers, ql-gown, ...)
  spread-02: scene is empty and must be authored
```

## Merge rules

- **New beat** appends a spread; every existing authored scene is untouched.
- **A spread not in the story** (a cover, a closing plate, a beat you removed) is KEPT and
  reported, never deleted.
- **A cast member in the spec but not in the beat** is kept and reported, on the assumption
  the author cast them deliberately.
- `--force` is the only way to lose authored text, and it says so.

## Definition of done

- The spec is a build artifact you can re-run at any time without fear.
- No per-book authoring script survives the session. If one does, it will rot.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:compose-spec

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead.
