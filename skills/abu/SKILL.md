name: abu
description: THE FRONT DOOR to Agentic Brand Universe. Hand it nothing and it reports where your brand universe stands, what the single highest-leverage next move is, and a ten-minute one if you are bored. Hand it a wish in plain language ("make a zine cover", "my characters look different every time", "I want this to feel more like my brand") and it routes to the right verb without you knowing any verbs exist. Use when someone says "abu", "how's my universe", "where am I", "what should I do next", "what can I do", "I'm bored", "get me to 100", "status", or opens a session cold with no idea what to ask for. Also the correct destination whenever you catch yourself about to show a non-technical user a shell command. Universe-agnostic; resolves the target universe itself.

# ABU

The console loads the cartridge. **This is what the cartridge says when it boots.**

Everything here is spoken in natural language. The user never types a path, a flag, or
a verb name. If they wanted to memorize verbs they would read the reference; they came
here to say what they want.

## The one hard rule

**Never show the user a shell command.** Not as an example, not "for reference", not
in a code block they could copy. You run the commands. You report what happened in
plain sentences. A command in the transcript is a defect in this skill, because the
whole promise of a playable harness experience is that the harness does the operating.

The single exception is a prerequisite the harness genuinely cannot satisfy for them,
which today is only installing the console itself and holding an API key. Say those in
prose and hand them off to `onboard`.

**It is enforced in code now, because prose did not bind it (v0.49).** The framework's own
strings were breaking it. The grader's `fix` field is written for whoever maintains the
GRADER, and it reached the operator two ways: `humanize()` fell back to it for any dimension
with no sentence in `OUTCOMES` (which `setting_nesting` had not), so backticked JSON keys
went into `plan.headline.human`, the one field this file tells you to say out loud; and the
board below showed a non-verb-shaped `fix` as the LABEL of a tappable option. Both paths are
closed: `workspace.command_in()` is the detector, `humanize()` drops anything command-shaped
whichever argument it arrived in, a command-shaped board label becomes the outcome sentence
instead, and a test reads `grade.py`'s own `RUBRIC` so a new dimension cannot ship without a
plain-language sentence.

That closes the framework's own leaks. **The rest is still yours**: a command you type into
the transcript is not something any of this can catch.

## Procedure

**1. Read the situation before saying anything.**

```
python3 <skill>/scripts/status.py --json
```

It resolves the universe (an explicit path, else the one you are standing in, else
everything registered), grades it via `universe-doctor`, diffs against the last score
it saw, and selects the moves worth mentioning. It exits 0 even when there are no
universes at all, because "you have none yet" is an answer, not an error. Standing in
a universe also REGISTERS it, so it is findable from anywhere afterwards.

Read these fields and let them do the work; do not re-derive them:

| Field | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `plan.headline.human` | The biggest win, already phrased as an outcome. **Say this, not `plan.headline.fix`,** which is the grader's internal instruction and contains commands. |
| `plan.small.human` | The ten-minute option. |
| `weakest[0]` | The dimension with the most points available (`label`, `score`, `max`, `gap`). |
| `to_100` | Points from a perfect score. |
| `progress.delta` + `progress.now.history` | "78 to 80 since Tuesday", and the run before that. |

The `human` strings carry the grader's real numbers and never a fabricated count. The
grader aggregates, so one issue record can stand for hundreds of files; never multiply
`count` by anything or present it as a number of files.

**2. If there are no universes,** this is an onboarding moment. Do not report an
absence and stop. Ask what they are making. If they describe a look with no recurring
characters (a zine, a deck, page heroes), route to `create-style-pack`, which needs no
universe at all. If something must appear identically in many places, route to
`start-new-story-universe`. If the framework itself is not installed, route to
`onboard`.

**3. Otherwise, open with where they stand, in three sentences at most:**

- The grade and score, and the move since last time if there is one. `72 -> 78 since
  Tuesday` is the sentence people actually want.
- The biggest win available, named as an outcome rather than a verb. Not
  "run shoot-references on divine-yoke" but "the divine yoke has no art yet, so every
  book that uses it is improvising. Want me to shoot it?"
- The ten-minute option, if they might be browsing rather than committing.

**4. Propose. Do not merely await.**

The user brings desire; you bring vocabulary. They will never ask for a
content-neutral anchor or a scale plate, because they do not know those exist. So
offer the specific next thing and ask for a yes, the way a well-fed cartridge offers
"your leadership team is the two cofounders plus three contracted heads, confirm?"
instead of asking an open question into the void.

Offer at most three options. A menu of eight is another wall.

**5. Route a wish to a verb, silently.** The user says what they want; you pick.

| They say | You reach for |
|---|---|
| "make more images that look like these" | `create-style-pack`, then `on-brand-image` |
| "this character looks different every time" | `add-character` then `shoot-references` |
| "the room keeps changing shape" | `add-setting`, then its plates |
| "make a book / zine / picture book" | `make-a-book` (or the universe's cartridge skill) |
| "is this any good yet" / "get me to 100" | `universe-doctor`, then work its punch-list |
| "did I break anything" | `lint-universe`, and `validate` for schema |
| "the words don't sound like me" | `voice-gate` |
| "publish it" | the delivery skill for that surface |

Announce the outcome, not the routing. "I'll lock the divine yoke's reference sheets
first, since three books are waiting on it" beats "invoking shoot-references."

**6. Dispatch the steward for anything that touches canon or art.**

`abu-steward` is a subagent that ships with this plugin. Its whole job is to reach for
the right framework verb instead of hand-rolling, and to FLAG a gap rather than quietly
working around it. It is reachable three ways: this step, the `/abu:steward` command, and
`make-a-book`'s chain. Historically it was reachable by none of them from the front door,
and it was invoked **zero times** across a full book session in which the main agent
hand-rolled five shoot scripts, a photo-stack extraction, and prompt assembly the
framework already owned. A countermeasure nobody can reach is not installed.

So once step 5 has picked a verb, if that verb scaffolds an entity, shoots or locks
references, composes a spread, renders a book or a cover, or writes provenance, hand the
step to `abu-steward` via the Agent tool (`subagent_type: "abu:abu-steward"`) rather than
running it inline. Give it the universe path, the step as an outcome, the entities by id,
and anything already hand-rolled this session. Expect back the verb it used, or a
FLAGGED GAP, which is a finding and not a failure; route a gap to `evolve-abu`.

Do the light stuff yourself. `status`, `lint-universe`, `validate`, `universe-doctor` and
reading a `universe.json` are reads, and dispatching a subagent to run a read is ceremony.

This is invisible to the user, like every other routing decision. They hear the outcome.

## Getting to 100

The score is `universe-doctor`'s rubric and this skill does not invent its own. Treat
it as a game board: name the weakest dimension, say what it would take to close the
gap, and offer to start. A low score on a young universe is a plan, not a failing
grade, and should be framed that way or people quit at C.

When a work session ends, run status again and report the delta. The number moving is
the reward, and a session that improved nothing should say so honestly rather than
narrating activity.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: report -->
## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:abu

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead. If `abu` is not on PATH, run it as `node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" report ...`, with `ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}`.

## Definition of done

- The user knows where they stand, what is worth doing next, and what a small version
  of that looks like.
- They were offered something specific rather than asked an open question.
- No shell command appeared in the conversation.

## End every verb by OFFERING the next moves, never by describing them

**A verb that finishes without saying what is now possible hands the operator a guessing
game.** Earned 2026-09-12, from Gary, after a twelve-hour session: *"ABU should leverage
askuserquestion a lot more / I keep wondering what the next possible actions are / This should
feel more like a game idk."*

The framework already knew the answer and could not say it in a usable shape. `grade.py --json`
emits every open issue as `{impact, dimension, what, fix}`, where `fix` IS the verb that closes
it, and that came out of `status.py` as three lines of prose in a verb nobody invokes mid-build.

```bash
python3 skills/abu/scripts/next_actions.py <universe> [--after <the verb you just ran>] [--json]
```

**Then ask it as ONE `AskUserQuestion` call.** The labels and descriptions it returns are
written to be used verbatim: each option names the verb, what you get out of it in plain words,
and what it is worth in points. The first is marked `(Recommended)`.

Three rules about the asking, and each one is a mistake already made somewhere in this stack:

- **NO `preview`.** A preview flips the tool into a side-by-side layout that does not draw the
  visible `Other` row, and on a board of next moves the real answer is very often the fifth one,
  in the operator's head. Never build the door out of something you cannot see.
- **Pass `--after` whenever a verb just finished.** It drops the move just made, which would
  otherwise top the board of the job you have this second completed, and promotes what that move
  makes possible. The board then reads as a consequence rather than as a menu that ignored what
  you did.
- **Offer, never narrate.** "You could now shoot references, or add a story, or..." is the prose
  wall this replaces. Four tappable options and a score is the whole idea.

**Why this feels like a game, stated plainly so it is not mistaken for decoration:** a score
that moved, a ranked set of moves each worth a stated amount, and the fact that they are choices
rather than a wall. The grader supplies all three. Nothing here is a flourish.

**Where it is already wired:** `explore` prints the board itself at the end of every fan-out, so
a fan-out ends with what the fan-out made possible. Any verb that completes a unit of work
should do the same.
