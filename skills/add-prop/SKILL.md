name: add-prop
description: Add ONE prop (a discrete physical object a character holds, wears, or uses, that must render identically wherever it appears) to an Agentic Brand Universe (interview what it is and its load-bearing detail, reuse-first via casting sweep, then scaffold a typed `prop` entity with SPEC §12's hero + detail reference slots and ready-to-run generation prompts). Art is NOT generated here (that is `shoot-references`). Use when a specific object needs to stay consistent across many renders. Generic and universe-parameterized: pass the target universe.

# Add Prop

One physical object, into a universe's canon, as a typed record with its reference slots scaffolded. This is authoring, not art: it ends with a validated `stub` entity + ready-to-run prompts. `shoot-references` generates and locks the shots afterward.

## Running `abu`

`abu <verb>` below is the engine CLI. When `abu` is not on PATH (a plugin install puts none there), run the same verb through the plugin's own entrypoint, from the directory you are already in:

    ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}
    node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" <verb> ...

With no `node`, the engine runs directly: `PYTHONPATH="${ABU%/}/engine" python3 -m agenticstory.cli <verb> ...`. Never `cd` into `engine/` to run it: a relative universe path then resolves inside the plugin.

## Inputs
- The target universe (a path containing `universe.json`). Read its `identity` (mark, register, voice) and `assetRoot`.
- What the object is and which character(s) use it.

## Procedure

1. **Casting sweep first (reuse wins).** Before naming a new prop, sweep `canon/entities/` + any CANON.md for an existing object that already covers this role (two characters can share one canonical prop). Only proceed if genuinely new.
2. **Interview (one question at a time).** Gather only what the reference matrix needs.
   - **DOES SOMETHING ALREADY DRAW IT? Ask this FIRST.** A site component, a generator, a locked render, a file on a live surface. If yes, that implementation IS the prop, and its prose will only ever be a lossy summary of it: record it as `structured.implementation` (SPEC §4.1.1: `kind` component | generator | asset, `path`, optional `repo` for a sibling repo, and for a component `compareAgainst`, a screenshot of the live original saved into the universe). Every later use then REUSES it and is compared against that original. If nothing draws it yet, write `{"kind": "none", "reason": "..."}` so the prose-only state is said out loud. Earned 2026-09-29: continental-works' continent motif lived only as a sentence, and a new surface drawn from the sentence came back as flat squares beside the ribbon.
   - **What it is.** The object's form, material, and who holds/wears/uses it and how.
   - **HOW BIG IT IS, IN HUMAN TERMS. Ask this explicitly and never skip it.** Not "a laptop": how wide, how tall, how big beside the hand that holds it or the desk it sits on. A prop that never states its size gets whatever size the model guesses, and every render inherits a different guess. This is the same rule `add-setting` applies to a room and `add-character` to a person, and a prop needs it more, because the reader already knows roughly how big a room and a person are.
   - **Its load-bearing detail.** The one specific feature that must never drift (an engraving, a wear mark, a color, a proportion). This is what the `detail` crop locks down; without it the prop reads as "a similar object," not "the same object."
3. **Scaffold the entity (tested machinery).** From the engine dir:
   ```bash
   python3 -m agenticstory.cli add-entity <universe> prop <id> --name "<Name>" [--origin <first-story>]
   ```
   This writes `canon/entities/<id>.json` with `structured.sheets: {"hero": null, "detail": null}` and `requiredForRender: []`. It prints `lock_level: stub`.
4. **Fill the prose + invariants.** Edit `prose` (voice/lore/rules: what the object means, who is allowed to touch it) and `structured.invariants` (the load-bearing rules the read-back will check, e.g. the exact detail from step 2).
4a. **State the size (SPEC §12, v0.49).** Fill `structured.scale.absolute` with the answer from step 2, as one plain sentence:

   ```json
   "scale": {
     "absolute": "a 14-inch notebook, 33cm wide, its open screen about twice the height of a mug beside it and about a quarter of the desk width",
     "relativeTo": {"other-entity-id": "about half the height of"}
   }
   ```

   `compose-spread` emits `absolute` as the TRUE SIZE line whenever this prop is in frame, alone or not, and it is the ONLY key it reads for a prop. `lint-universe` warns `PROP-NO-SCALE` when it is absent and `PROP-SCALE-NOT-EMITTED` when a size sits under any other key, which is the worse state: the prop looks compliant and contributes nothing to any prompt.

   - **PIN THE SIZE TO THINGS A RENDER ALREADY CONTAINS.** "33cm wide" is unverifiable in a painting and "about twice the height of the mug beside it" is checkable at read-back by looking. Write the ratio, then the measurement.
   - **The incident.** On `what-a-book-is-made-of` the supercharged laptop appears in most of twenty-one spreads and ranged from a notebook to a small television. The entity declared its FORM, its COLOUR and its rules and never once declared its SIZE. Colour was meaning; scale was a guess, and Gary caught it by eye: "why does the laptop look different sizes?" This is the prop version of the hearth room that earned the setting rule in v0.9.
   - **A code-drawn scale plate is the cheapest way to get the ratios right.** Model the object beside a desk, a mug and a spread hand in a `massing` spec (`add-generator`) and render it: deterministic, free, and it gives you a reference image to pass as well as the numbers to write down.

5. **Write the generation prompts.** Create `reference/<id>/prompts.md`: a **hero** shot (the object cleanly framed, its full form visible) and a **detail** crop (a tight close-up on the load-bearing feature). Each prompt: (a) passes `identity.register.anchor` FIRST and bakes `register.rejectedPoles` as negatives; (b) states the invariant that must never drift; (c) names the target output path `reference/<id>/<shot>.png`. These are what `shoot-references` will run.
6. **Validate + commit.** `abu validate <universe>` stays green. Commit the entity + reference dir + prompts.md. Report `lock_level: stub` and that the next step is `shoot-references <universe> <id>`.

## Gates honored
- **Reuse-first** (step 1): never invent a second prop an existing entity already covers.
- **A prop must be able to prove its own size** (step 4a): `structured.scale.absolute` is filled, so the TRUE SIZE line reaches every prompt this prop appears in. The same discipline `add-setting` enforces with `contract.scale` and `add-character` with `structured.scale`.
- **No art here**: generation is `shoot-references`, so this skill never calls an image model.

## Not this skill
- Generating/locking the shots → `shoot-references`.
- A character, setting, visual-metaphor, story, or relation → the sibling `add-*` skills. A recurring visual pattern not tied to a single discrete object (a gesture, a light quality) is `add-motif`.

## When this skill misfires, offer to report it

If this skill did not one-shot (a step failed, a check refused something it should not have, an instruction sent you the wrong way, you fixed its output by hand, or it left out an obvious step), the person running it is the only one who knows, and only right now. Offer once, in one line, to report it. On a yes, run it yourself and never show them the command:

    abu report "<what happened>" --expected "<what should have happened, and why>" --command "<the exact command or ask>" --skill abu:add-prop

Write every field from what you just watched: an issue that says what was expected and how to reproduce it gets fixed, and "it broke" does not. A `check-kit` refusal they believe is wrong is `abu check-kit ... --report`, which attaches the findings and the rule each one broke. It prints a pre-filled GitHub issue and sends nothing: hand them the link to read and submit. Inside Freedom, `freedom:suggest-an-improvement` files it for them. If you maintain ABU itself, fix it through `evolve-abu` instead. If `abu` is not on PATH, run it as `node "${ABU%/}/bin/abu.mjs" report ...`, with `ABU=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/abu/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)}`.
